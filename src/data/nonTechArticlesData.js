      articleText: `<p>&nbsp;</p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>            <h1>Microeconomics vs. Macroeconomics: What&rsquo;s the Difference?</h1>            <p>&nbsp;</p>            <h2>Microeconomics vs. Macroeconomics: An Overview</h2>            <p>Economics is divided into two categories: microeconomics and macroeconomics. Microeconomics is the study of individuals and business decisions, while&nbsp;macroeconomics looks at the decisions of countries and governments.</p>            <p>Though these two branches of economics appear different, they are actually interdependent and complement one another. Many overlapping issues exist between the two fields.</p>            <h3>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h3>            <ul>        <li>Microeconomics studies individuals and business decisions, while&nbsp;macroeconomics analyzes the decisions made by countries and governments.</li>        <li>Microeconomics focuses on supply and demand, and other forces that determine price levels, making it a bottom-up approach.</li>        <li>Macroeconomics takes a top-down approach and looks at the economy as a whole, trying to determine its course and nature.</li>        <li>Investors can use microeconomics in their investment decisions, while macroeconomics is an analytical tool mainly used to craft economic and fiscal policy.</li>      </ul>            <p>&nbsp;</p>            <h4>&nbsp;</h4>            <h2>Microeconomics</h2>            <p>Microeconomics&nbsp;is the study of decisions made by people and businesses regarding the allocation of resources, and prices at which they trade goods and services. It considers taxes, regulations, and government legislation.</p>            <p>Microeconomics focuses on supply and demand and other forces that determine price levels in the economy. It takes a&nbsp;bottom-up&nbsp;approach to analyze the economy. In other words, microeconomics tries to understand human choices, decisions, and the allocation of resources.</p>            <p>Having said that, microeconomics does not try to answer or explain what forces should take place in a market. Rather, it tries to explain what happens when there are changes in certain conditions.</p>            <p>For example, microeconomics examines how a company could maximize its production and capacity so that&nbsp;it could lower prices and better compete. A lot of microeconomic information can be gleaned from company financial statements.</p>            <p>Microeconomics involves several key principles, including (but not limited to):</p>            <ul>        <li><strong>Demand, Supply and&nbsp;Equilibrium</strong>: Prices are determined by the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/law-of-supply-demand.asp">law of supply and demand</a>. In a perfectly competitive market, suppliers offer the same price demanded&nbsp;by consumers. This creates economic equilibrium.</li>        <li><strong>Production Theory</strong>: This principle is the study of how goods and services are created or manufactured.</li>        <li><strong>Costs of Production</strong>: According to this theory, the price of goods or services is determined by the cost of the resources used during production.</li>        <li><strong>Labor Economics</strong>: This principle looks at workers and employers, and tries to understand patterns of wages, employment, and&nbsp;income.&nbsp;</li>      </ul>            <p>The rules in microeconomics flow from a set of compatible laws and theorems, rather than beginning with empirical study.</p>            <h2>Macroeconomics</h2>            <p>Macroeconomics, on the other hand, studies the behavior of a country and how its policies impact the economy as a whole. It analyzes entire industries and economies, rather than individuals or specific companies, which is why it&rsquo;s a top-down approach. It tries to answer questions such as &ldquo;What should the rate of inflation be?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What stimulates economic growth?&rdquo;</p>            <p>&nbsp;</p>            <p>Macroeconomics examines economy-wide phenomena such as gross domestic product (GDP) and how it is affected by changes in unemployment, national income, rates of growth, and price levels.</p>            <p>Macroeconomics analyzes how an increase or decrease in net exports impacts a nation&rsquo;s capital account, or how&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gdp.asp">gross domestic product (GDP)</a>&nbsp;is impacted by the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unemploymentrate.asp">unemployment rate</a>.</p>            <p>Macroeconomics focuses on aggregates and&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/econometrics.asp">econometric correlations</a>, which is why governments and their agencies rely on macroeconomics to formulate economic and fiscal policy. Investors who buy interest-rate-sensitive securities should keep a close eye on monetary and fiscal policy.</p>            <p><aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/john_maynard_keynes.asp">John Maynard Keynes</a>&nbsp;is often credited as the founder of macroeconomics, as he initiated&nbsp;the use of monetary aggregates to study broad phenomena. Some economists&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/012615/what-difference-between-keynesian-economics-and-monetarist-economics.asp">dispute his theories</a>, while many Keynesians&nbsp;disagree on how to interpret his work.</p>            <h2>Investors and Microeconomics vs. Macroeconomics</h2>            <p>Individual investors may be better off focusing on microeconomics, but macroeconomics cannot be ignored altogether.&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundamentalanalysis.asp">Fundamental</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valueinvesting.asp">value</a>&nbsp;investors may disagree with technical investors about the proper role of economic analysis. While it is more likely that microeconomics will impact individual investments, macroeconomic factors can affect entire portfolios.</p>            <p>Warren Buffett<strong>&nbsp;</strong>famously stated that macroeconomic forecasts didn&rsquo;t influence his investing decisions. When asked how he and partner Charlie Munger choose investments, Buffett said, &ldquo;Charlie and I don&rsquo;t pay attention to macro forecasts. We have worked together now for 54 years, and I can&rsquo;t think of a time we made a decision on a stock, or on a company ... where we&rsquo;ve talked about macro.&rdquo;1&nbsp;Buffett also has referred to macroeconomic literature as &ldquo;the funny papers.&rdquo;2</p>            <p>John Templeton, another famously successful value investor, shared a similar sentiment. &ldquo;I never ask if the market is going to go up or down because I don&rsquo;t know, and besides, it doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo;&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.forbes.com/2008/07/11/sir-john-templeton-pf-guru-in_jc_0711borderless_inl.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Templeton told&nbsp;<em>Forbes</em>&nbsp;in 1978</a>. &ldquo;I search nation after nation for stocks, asking: &lsquo;Where is the one that is lowest priced in relation to what I believe it&rsquo;s worth?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>            <h2>Can Macroeconomic Factors Affect My Investment Portfolio?</h2>            <p>Yes, macroeconomic factors can have a significant influence on your investment portfolio. For example, the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great-recession.asp">Great Recession</a>&nbsp;of 2008&ndash;09 and accompanying market crash were caused by the bursting of the U.S. housing bubble and subsequent near-collapse of financial institutions that were heavily invested in U.S. subprime mortgages.</p>            <p>For another example of the effect of macro factors on investment portfolios, consider the response of central banks and governments to the pandemic-induced crash of spring 2020. Governments and central banks unleashed torrents of liquidity through fiscal and monetary stimulus to prop up their economies and stave off recession, which had the effect of pushing most major equity markets to record highs in the second half of 2020 and throughout much of 2021.</p>            <h2>What Is a Global Macro Strategy?</h2>            <p>A&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/globalmacro.asp">global macro strategy</a>&nbsp;is an investment and trading strategy that centers around large macroeconomic events at a national or global level. &ldquo;Global Macro&rdquo; involves research and analysis of numerous macroeconomic factors, including interest rates, currency levels, political developments, and country relations.</p>            <h2>What Is the Basic Difference Between Microeconomics and Macroeconomics?</h2>            <p>Microeconomics is the study of how individuals and companies make decisions to allocate scarce resources. Macroeconomics is the study of an economy as a whole.</p>            <h2>How Do Core Concepts of Microeconomics Such as Supply and Demand Affect Stock Prices?</h2>            <p>Microeconomic concepts such as supply and demand affect stocks prices in two ways: directly and indirectly.</p>            <ul>        <li>The direct effect can be gauged by the impact of demand and supply&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/disequilibrium.asp">disequilibrium</a>&nbsp;on stock prices. When demand for a stock exceeds supply at a given point in time because there are more buyers than sellers, the stock will rise; conversely, when supply exceeds demand because there are more sellers than buyers, the stock will fall.</li>        <li>The indirect effect is based on supply and demand for the underlying company&rsquo;s products and services. If the company&rsquo;s products are flying off the shelves because of robust demand, it may be on a probable strong earnings trajectory that would likely translate into a higher price for its stock. But if demand is sluggish and there is excess inventory (or supply) of its products, the company&rsquo;s earnings may disappoint and the stock may slump.</li>      </ul>            <h2>Does My Portfolio Performance Hinge on Both Microeconomic and Macroeconomic Factors?</h2>            <p>Yes, the performance of your portfolio hinges on both microeconomic and macroeconomic factors. Microeconomic factors such as supply and demand, taxes and regulations, and macroeconomic factors such as gross domestic product (GDP) growth, inflation, and interest rates, have a significant influence on different sectors of the economy and hence on your investment portfolio.</p>`,

        `<h1>Scarcity: What It Means in Economics and What Causes It</h1>      <p>&nbsp;</p>            <h2>What Is Scarcity?</h2>            <p>Scarcity is an economics concept rooted in one of the most basic facts of life: we live in a world of limited resources that requires choices about how they are allocated. In that sense, every product down to a pack of gum or a book of matches is scarce, since someone expended resources that could have been deployed elsewhere to produce it.</p>            <p>Scarcity is so fundamental to economics that scarce goods are also known as economic goods. In economics, scarce goods are those for which demand would exceed supply at a price of zero.1</p>            <p>Some&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/common-resource.asp">natural resources</a>&nbsp;that may appear to be free because they are easily and widely accessible eventually prove scarce as they are depleted from overuse in a&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tragedy-of-the-commons.asp">tragedy of the commons</a>. Economists increasingly view clean air and a climate compatible with human welfare as scarce goods because of the significant cost of protecting them, and may place a price on them for the purposes of a&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cost-benefitanalysis.asp">cost-benefit analysis</a>.23</p>            <h3>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h3>            <ul>        <li>In economics, the concept of scarcity conveys the opportunity cost of allocating limited resources.</li>        <li>Scarce goods are those for which demand would exceed supply if they were free</li>        <li>Common resources like clean air and a sustainable climate have been increasingly recognized as scarce goods with costs as well as value.</li>        <li>Scarcity can also be used to denote the relative availability of production inputs or the decrease in the supply of a resource or product relative to demand over time.</li>      </ul>            <p>&nbsp;</p>            <h2>Understanding Scarcity</h2>            <p>In his 1932&nbsp;<em>Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science</em>, British&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economist.asp">economist</a>&nbsp;Lionel Robbins defined the discipline in terms of scarcity:</p>            <blockquote>Economics is the science which studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.4</blockquote>            <p><br />      In a hypothetical world in which everything of value&mdash;from food and water to masterworks of art&mdash;were so abundant it had no cost, economists would have nothing to study. There would be no need to make decisions about how to allocate resources, hence no need for theories about the interplay of such decisions and tradeoffs in an economy.</p>            <p>In the real world, on the other hand, all&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/factors-production.asp">factors of production</a>&nbsp;have a cost and therefore so too does every product. Every&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/factor-market.asp">input</a>&nbsp;incurs an&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/opportunitycost.asp">opportunity cost</a>&nbsp;because it can&#39;t be put to alternate use as a result.&nbsp;This opportunity cost reflects the inputs&#39; scarcity.</p>            <h2>Natural Resource&nbsp;Scarcity</h2>            <p>Even abundant&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/common-resource.asp">common resources</a>&nbsp;long consumed at zero apparent cost often prove neither free nor limitless eventually. Climate isn&#39;t a&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tangibleasset.asp">tangible asset</a>&nbsp;and its value is hard to calculate, but the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0210/7-ways-climate-change-affects-companies.aspx">costs of climate change for companies</a>&nbsp;as well as the society are all too real. Air is free, but clean air has a cost in terms of the economic activity discouraged to prevent pollution, as well as value for health and&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quality-of-life.asp">quality of life</a>.</p>            <p>To preserve the benefits associated with these resources, governments may require manufacturers and utilities to invest in pollution control equipment, or to adopt cleaner power sources. Governments and the regulated industries eventually pass on these costs to taxpayers and consumers. Breathing freely, in other words, is not really free.</p>            <h2>Relative Scarcity of Inputs</h2>            <p>While scarcity is fundamental to economics and the human condition, the term is also used to describe the relative availability of factors or production or economic inputs.5</p>            <p>For example, imagine a hypothetical widget requiring just two labor inputs: workers and managers, with one manager required per 20 workers. Imagine further that the available labor pool consists of 20,000 workers and 5,000 managers. Clearly, there are more available workers than managers. Yet in terms of the proportion required to produce the widgets, workers are the relatively scarce resource, since they&#39;re required in a ratio of 20 per manager for production, but outnumber managers by a ratio of only 4 to 1 in the labor pool.</p>            <p>The factors of production compared this way could just as easily be land and dairy cattle. If pasture land were the limiting factor in milk production, land could be said to be relatively scarce. Conversely, if the principal production constraint was the size of the herd, cattle would be the relatively scarce factor of production.</p>            <h2>Scarcity as Market Mover</h2>            <p>Scarcity may also be used to denote a change in a&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equilibrium.asp">market equilibrium</a>&nbsp;raising the price of the resource based on the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/law-of-supply-demand.asp">law of supply and demand</a>. In those instances, scarcity denotes a decrease over time in the supply of the product or commodity relative to the demand for it.6</p>            <p>The growing scarcity reflected in the higher price required to attain a market equilibrium could be attributable to one or more of the following:</p>            <ul>        <li>Demand-induced scarcity reflecting rising demand</li>        <li>Supply-induced scarcity caused by diminished supply</li>        <li>Structural scarcity attributable to mismanagement or inequality</li>      </ul>            <h2>Does Scarcity Mean Something Is Hard to Obtain?</h2>            <p>None of the economic definitions of scarcity require a product or resource to be unavailable to be called scarce. In fact, the definition of a&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market-price.asp">market price</a>&nbsp;is one at which supply equals demand, meaning all those willing to obtain the resource at a market price can do so. Scarcity can be used to explain a market shift to a higher price, to compare the availability of economic inputs, or to convey the opportunity cost involved in allocating limited resources.</p>            <h2>Are There Goods That Are Not Scarce?</h2>            <p>This article is free to read. Other forms of easily reproduced&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intellectualproperty.asp">intellectual property</a>, including films and music, derive their scarcity from&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/copyright.asp">copyright protection</a>, while the inventors of new drugs and devices must secure&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/patent.asp">patents</a>&nbsp;to deter imitators. In a world of limited resources, many apparently free goods may have an indirect or&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/investing/costs-investing/">hidden cost</a>. If the free stock trade does not ensure&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bestexecution.asp">best execution</a>, perhaps it has a cost, just like clean air.</p>            <h2>How Can a Society Deal With Scarcity?</h2>            <p>Societies can deal with scarcity by increasing supply. The more goods and services available to all, the less scarcity there will be. Of course, increasing supply comes with limitations, such as production capacity, land available for use, time, and so on. Another way to deal with scarcity is by reducing demand. Rising prices may play that role in&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/100314/whats-difference-between-market-economy-and-command-economy.asp">market economies</a>, while command economies might use&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quota.asp">quotas</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rationing.asp">rationing</a>. In practice,&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/031815/united-states-considered-market-economy-or-mixed-economy.asp">mixed economies</a>&nbsp;also frequently use quotas and&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-cap-regulation.asp">price caps</a>.</p>      <h1>&nbsp;</h1><h1>&nbsp;</h1><h1>&nbsp;</h1><h1>Opportunity Cost Formula, Calculation, and What It Can Tell You</h1><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>What Is Opportunity Cost?</h2><p>Opportunity costs represent the potential benefits that an individual, investor, or business misses out on when choosing one alternative over another. Because opportunity costs are unseen by definition, they can be easily overlooked. Understanding the potential missed opportunities when a business or individual chooses one investment over another allows for better decision making.</p><h3>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h3><ul>	<li>Opportunity cost is the forgone benefit that would have been derived from an option not chosen.</li>	<li>To properly evaluate opportunity costs, the costs and benefits of every option available must be considered and weighed against the others.</li>	<li>Considering the value of opportunity costs can guide individuals and organizations to more profitable decision-making.</li>	<li>Opportunity cost is a strictly internal cost used for strategic contemplation; it is not included in accounting profit and is excluded from external financial reporting.</li>	<li>Examples of opportunity cost include investing in a new manufacturing plant in Los Angeles as opposed to Mexico City, deciding not to upgrade company equipment, or opting for the most expensive product packaging option over cheaper options.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Formula and Calculation of Opportunity Cost</h2><p>Opportunity&nbsp;Cost=FO&minus;COwhere:FO=Return&nbsp;on&nbsp;best&nbsp;forgone&nbsp;optionCO=Return&nbsp;on&nbsp;chosen&nbsp;option​Opportunity&nbsp;Cost=FO&minus;COwhere:FO=Return&nbsp;on&nbsp;best&nbsp;forgone&nbsp;optionCO=Return&nbsp;on&nbsp;chosen&nbsp;option​</p><p>The formula for calculating an opportunity cost is simply the difference between the expected returns of each option. Consider a company is faced with the following two mutually exclusive options:</p><p><strong>Option A: Invest excess capital in the stock market to potentially earn&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalgain.asp">capital gains</a>.</strong></p><p><strong>Option B: Invest excess capital back into the business for new equipment to increase production efficiency.</strong></p><p>Assume the expected&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestment.asp">return on investment</a>&nbsp;(ROI) in the stock market is 12% over the next year, and your company expects the equipment update to generate a 10% return over the same period. The opportunity cost of choosing the equipment over the stock market is 2% (12% - 10%). In other words, by investing in the business, the company would forgo the opportunity to earn a higher return.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>While&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-statements.asp">financial reports</a>&nbsp;do not show opportunity costs, business owners often use the concept to make educated decisions when they have multiple options before them.&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bottleneck.asp">Bottlenecks</a>, for instance, often result in opportunity costs.</p><h2>What Opportunity Cost Can Tell You</h2><p>Opportunity cost analysis plays a crucial role in determining a business&rsquo;s&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalstructure.asp">capital structure</a>. A firm incurs an expense in issuing both&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debt.asp">debt</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity.asp#:~:text=Equity%20is%20used%20as%20capital,equity%20%28by%20selling%20stock%29.">equity capital</a>&nbsp;to compensate lenders and shareholders for the risk of investment, yet each also carries an opportunity cost.</p><p>Funds used to make payments on loans, for example, cannot be invested in stocks or bonds, which offer the potential for&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentincome.asp">investment income</a>. The company must decide if the expansion made by the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/111813/optimal-use-financial-leverage-corporate-capital-structure.asp">leveraging power of debt</a>&nbsp;will generate greater profits than it could make through investments.</p><p>A firm tries to weigh the costs and benefits of issuing debt and stock, including both monetary and nonmonetary considerations, to arrive at an optimal balance that minimizes opportunity costs. Because opportunity cost is a forward-looking consideration, the actual&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rateofreturn.asp">rate of return</a>&nbsp;(RoR) for both options is unknown today, making this evaluation tricky in practice.</p><p>Assume that the company in the above example forgoes new equipment and instead invests in the stock market. If the selected securities decrease in value, the company could end up losing money rather than enjoying the expected 12% return.</p><p>For the sake of simplicity, assume that the investment yields a return of 0%, meaning the company gets out exactly what is put in. The opportunity cost of choosing this option is 10% to 0%, or 10%. It is equally possible that, had the company chosen new equipment, there would be no effect on production efficiency, and profits would remain stable. The opportunity cost of choosing this option is then 12%&nbsp;rather than the expected 2%.</p><p>It is important to compare investment options that have a similar risk. Comparing a&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurybill.asp">Treasury bill</a>, which is virtually risk free,&nbsp;to investment in a highly&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp">volatile</a>&nbsp;stock can cause a misleading calculation. Both options may have expected returns of 5%, but the U.S. government backs the RoR of the T-bill, while there is no such guarantee in the stock market. While the opportunity cost of either option is 0%, the T-bill is the safer bet when you consider&nbsp;the relative risk of each investment.</p><h3>Comparing Investments</h3><p>When assessing the potential profitability of various investments, businesses look for the option that is likely to&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/yield.asp">yield</a>&nbsp;the greatest return. Often, they can determine this by looking at the expected RoR for an investment vehicle. However, businesses must also consider the opportunity cost of each alternative option.1</p><p>Assume that, given $20,000 of available funds, a business must choose between investing funds in&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment-securities.asp">securities</a>&nbsp;or using it to purchase new machinery. No matter which option the business chooses, the potential profit that it&nbsp;gives up by not investing in the other option is the opportunity cost.</p><p>If the business goes with the first option, at the end of the first year, its investment will be worth $22,000. The formula to calculate RoR is [(Current Value - Initial Value) &divide; Current Value] &times; 100. In this example, [($22,000 - $20,000) &divide; $20,000] &times; 100 = 10%, so the RoR on the investment is 10%. For the purposes of this example, let&rsquo;s assume it would net 10% every year after as well. At a 10% RoR, with&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compoundinterest.asp">compounding interest</a>, the investment will increase by $2,000 in year 1, $2,200 in year two, and $2,420 in year three.</p><p>Alternatively, if the business purchases a new machine, it will be able to increase its production of widgets. The machine setup and employee training will be intensive, and the new machine will not be up to maximum efficiency for the first couple of years. Let&rsquo;s assume it would net the company an additional $500 in profits in the first year, after accounting for the additional expenses for training. The business will net $2,000 in year two and $5,000 in all future years.</p><p>Since the company has limited funds to invest in either option, it must make a choice. According to this, the opportunity cost for choosing the securities makes sense in the first and second years. However, by the third year, an analysis of the opportunity cost indicates that the new machine is the better option ($500 + $2,000 + $5,000 - $2,000 - $2,200 - $2,420) = $880.</p><h3>The Most Expensive Pizza Ever?</h3><p>One of the most famous examples of opportunity cost is a 2010 exchange of Bitcoin for pizza.2&nbsp;The opportunity cost of exchanging the 10,000 bitcoins for two large pizzas peaked at almost $700 million based on Bitcoin&#39;s 2022 all-time high price.3</p><h2>The Difference Between Opportunity Cost and Sunk Cost</h2><p>A&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sunkcost.asp">sunk cost</a>&nbsp;is money already spent in the past, while opportunity cost is the potential returns not earned in the future on an investment because the capital was invested elsewhere. When considering opportunity cost, any sunk costs previously incurred are ignored unless there are specific variable outcomes related to those funds.</p><p>Buying 1,000 shares of company A at $10 a share, for instance, represents a sunk cost of $10,000. This is the amount of money paid out to invest, and getting that money back requires liquidating stock. The opportunity cost instead asks where that $10,000 could have been put to better use.</p><p>From an accounting perspective, a sunk cost also could refer to the initial outlay to purchase an expensive piece of heavy equipment, which might be&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/amortization.asp">amortized</a>&nbsp;over time, but which is sunk in the sense that you won&rsquo;t be getting it back.4</p><p>An opportunity cost would be to consider the forgone returns possibly earned elsewhere when you buy a piece of heavy equipment with an expected ROI of 5% vs. one with an ROI of 4%. Again, an opportunity cost describes the returns that one could have earned if the money were instead invested in another instrument. Thus, while 1,000 shares in company A eventually might sell for $12 a share, netting a profit of&nbsp;$2,000, company B increased in value from $10 a share to $15 during the same period.</p><p>In this scenario, investing $10,000 in company A returned $2,000, while the same amount invested in company B would have returned a larger $5,000. The $3,000 difference&nbsp;is the opportunity cost of choosing&nbsp;company A over company B.</p><p>As an investor who has already put money into investments, you might find another investment that promises greater returns. The opportunity cost of holding the underperforming asset may rise to the point where the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock-trader.asp">rational investment option</a>&nbsp;is to sell and invest in the more promising investment.</p><h2>Opportunity Cost and Risk</h2><p>In economics,&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk.asp">risk</a>&nbsp;describes the possibility that an investment&rsquo;s actual and projected returns are different and that the investor loses some or all of the principal. Opportunity cost concerns the possibility that the returns of a chosen investment are lower than the returns of a forgone investment.</p><p>The key difference is that risk compares the actual performance of an investment against the projected performance of the same investment, while opportunity cost compares the actual performance of an investment against the actual performance of another investment.</p><p>Still, one could consider opportunity costs when deciding between two risk profiles. If investment A is risky but has an ROI of 25%, while investment B is far less risky but only has an ROI of 5%, even though investment A may succeed, it may not. If it fails, then the opportunity cost of going with option B will be salient. Therefore, decision-makers rely on much more information than just looking at just opportunity cost dollar amounts when comparing options.</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><p>In 1962, a little known band called The Beatles auditioned for Decca Records. The label decided against signing the band. This decision would have been made because the opportunity cost to sign them did not outweigh the opportunity cost to pass on them.5</p><h2>Economic Profit and Accounting Profit</h2><p>Opportunity cost is used to calculate different types of company profit. The most common type of profit analysts are familiar with is accounting profit. Accounting profit is the net income calculation often stipulated by&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gaap.asp">Generally Accepted Accounting Principles</a>&nbsp;(GAAP). Only explicit, real costs are subtracted from total revenue.</p><p>Companies or analysts can future manipulate accounting profit to arrive at an economic profit. The difference between the calculation of the two is economic profit includes opportunity cost as an expense. This theoretical calculation can then be used to compare the actual profit of the company to what the theoretical profit would have been.</p><p>Economic profit (and any other calculation above that considers opportunity cost) is strictly an internal value used for strategic decision-making. There are no regulatory bodies that govern public reporting of economic profit or opportunity cost. Whereas accounting profit is heavily dictated by reporting rules and frameworks, economic profit factors in vague assumptions and estimates from management that do not have IRS, SEC, or FASB oversight.</p><h2>Example of Opportunity Cost</h2><p>Before making big decisions like buying a home or&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/09/start-business-in-depressed-economy.asp">starting a business</a>, you probably will scrupulously research the pros and cons of your financial decision, but most day-to-day choices aren&rsquo;t made with a full understanding of the potential opportunity costs.</p><p>When feeling cautious about a purchase, for instance, many people will check the balance of their savings account before spending money. But they often won&rsquo;t think about the things that they must give up when they make that spending decision.</p><p>The problem comes up when you never look at what else you could do with your money or buy things without considering the lost opportunities. Having takeout for lunch occasionally can be a wise decision, especially if it gets you out of the office for a much-needed break.</p><p>However, buying one cheeseburger every day for the next 25 years could lead to several missed opportunities. Aside from the missed opportunity for better health, spending that $4.50 on a burger could add up to just over $52,000 in that time frame, assuming a very achievable 5% RoR.</p><p>This is a simple example, but the core message holds for a variety of situations. It may sound like overkill to think about opportunity costs every time you want to buy a candy bar or go on vacation. But opportunity costs are everywhere and occur with every decision made, big or small.</p><h2>What Is a Simple Definition of Opportunity Cost?</h2><p>Opportunity cost is often overlooked by investors. In essence, it refers to the hidden cost associated with not taking an alternative course of action. If, for example, a company pursues a particular business strategy without first considering the merits of alternative strategies available to them, they might fail to appreciate their opportunity costs and the possibility that they could have done even better had they chosen another path.</p><h2>Is Opportunity Cost Real?</h2><p>Opportunity cost does not show up directly on a company&rsquo;s financial statements. Economically speaking, though, opportunity costs are still very real. Yet because opportunity cost is a relatively abstract concept, many companies, executives, and investors fail to account for it in their everyday decision making.</p><h2>What Is An Example of Opportunity Cost?</h2><p>Consider the case of an investor who, at age 18, was encouraged by their parents to always put 100% of their disposable income into bonds. Over the next 50 years, this investor dutifully invested $5,000 per year in bonds, achieving an average annual return of 2.50% and retiring with a portfolio worth nearly $500,000. Although this result might seem impressive, it is less so when one considers the investor&rsquo;s opportunity cost. If, for example, they had instead invested half of their money in the stock market and received an average blended return of 5%, then their retirement portfolio would have been worth more than $1 million.</p><h2>How Do You Determine Opportunity Cost?</h2><p>The downside of opportunity cost is it is heavily reliant on estimates and assumptions. There&#39;s no way of knowing exactly how a different course of action may have played out financially. Therefore, to determine opportunity cost, a company or investor must project the outcome and forecast the financial impact. This includes projecting sales numbers, market penetration, customer demographics, manufacturing costs, customer returns, and seasonality.</p><p>This complex situation pinpoints the reason why opportunity cost exists. It may not be immediately clear to a company the best course of action; however, after retrospectively assessing the variables above, they may further understand how one option would have been better than the other and they have incurred a &quot;loss&quot; due to opportunity cost.</p>`,

        `<h1>Gross Domestic Product (GDP): Formula and How to Use It</h1><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>What Is Gross Domestic Product (GDP)?</h2><p>Gross domestic product (GDP) is the total monetary or market value of all the finished goods and services produced within a country&rsquo;s borders in a specific time period. As a broad measure of overall domestic production, it functions as a comprehensive scorecard of a given country&rsquo;s economic health.</p><p>Though GDP is typically calculated on an annual basis, it is sometimes calculated on a quarterly basis as well. In the U.S., for example, the government releases an&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/annualize.asp">annualized</a>&nbsp;GDP estimate for each fiscal quarter and also for the calendar year. The individual data sets included in this report are given in real terms, so the data is adjusted for price changes and is, therefore, net of&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp">inflation</a>.1</p><h3>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h3><ul>	<li>Gross domestic product is the monetary value of all finished goods and services made within a country during a specific period.</li>	<li>GDP provides an economic snapshot of a country, used to estimate the size of an economy and its growth rate.</li>	<li>GDP can be calculated in three ways, using expenditures, production, or incomes and it can be adjusted for inflation and population to provide deeper insights.</li>	<li>Real GDP takes into account the effects of inflation while nominal GDP does not.</li>	<li>Though it has limitations, GDP is a key tool to guide policymakers, investors, and businesses in strategic decision-making.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Understanding Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</h2><p>The calculation of a country&rsquo;s GDP encompasses all private and public consumption, government outlays, investments, additions to private inventories, paid-in construction costs, and the foreign&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bot.asp">balance of trade</a>. (Exports are added to the value and imports are subtracted).</p><p>Of all the components that make up a country&rsquo;s GDP, the foreign balance of trade is especially important. The GDP of a country tends to increase when the total value of goods and services that domestic producers sell to foreign countries exceeds the total value of foreign goods and services that domestic consumers buy. When this situation occurs, a country is said to have a&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trade-surplus.asp">trade surplus</a>.</p><p>If the opposite situation occurs&mdash;if the amount that domestic consumers spend on foreign products is greater than the total sum of what domestic producers are able to sell to foreign consumers&mdash;it is called a&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/trade-deficit-effects-on-stock-market/">trade deficit</a>. In this situation, the GDP of a country tends to decrease.</p><p>GDP can be computed on a nominal basis or a real basis, the latter accounting for inflation. Overall, real GDP is a better method for expressing long-term national economic performance since it uses&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/constantdollar.asp">constant dollars</a>.</p><p>Let&#39;s say one country had a nominal GDP of $100 billion in 2012. By 2022, its nominal GDP grew to $150 billion. Prices also rose by 100% over the same period. In this example, if you looked solely at its nominal GDP, the country&#39;s economy appears to be performing well. However, the real GDP (expressed in 2012 dollars) would only be $75 billion, revealing that an overall decline in real economic performance actually occurred during this time.</p><h3>3.2%</h3><p>The annual rate of increase for U.S. GDP in the third quarter of 2022. U.S. GDP recorded a 0.6% decrease in the second quarter of 2022.2</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Types of Gross Domestic Product</h2><p>GDP can be reported in several ways, each of which provides slightly different information.</p><h3>Nominal GDP</h3><p><aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nominalgdp.asp">Nominal GDP</a>&nbsp;is an assessment of economic production in an economy that includes current prices in its calculation. In other words, it doesn&rsquo;t strip out inflation or the pace of rising prices, which can inflate the growth figure.</p><p>All goods and services counted in nominal GDP are valued at the prices that those goods and services are actually sold for in that year. Nominal GDP&nbsp;is evaluated in either the local currency or U.S. dollars at currency market exchange rates to compare countries&rsquo; GDPs in purely financial terms.</p><p>Nominal GDP is used when comparing different quarters of output within the same year. When comparing the GDP of two or more years, real GDP is used. This is because, in effect, the removal of the influence of inflation allows the comparison of the different years to focus solely on volume.</p><h3>Real GDP</h3><p><aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/realgdp.asp">Real GDP</a>&nbsp;is an inflation-adjusted measure that reflects the number of goods and services produced by an economy in a given year, with prices held constant from year to year to separate out the impact of inflation or deflation from the trend in output over time. Since GDP is based on the monetary value of goods and services, it is subject to inflation.</p><p>Rising prices tend to increase a country&rsquo;s GDP, but this does not necessarily reflect any change in the quantity or quality of goods and services produced. Thus, by looking just at an economy&rsquo;s nominal GDP, it can be difficult to tell whether the figure has risen because of a real expansion in production or simply because prices rose.</p><p>Economists use a process that adjusts for inflation to arrive at an economy&rsquo;s real GDP. By adjusting the output in any given year for the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price_level.asp">price levels</a>&nbsp;that prevailed in a reference year, called the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/base-year.asp">base year</a>,&nbsp;economists can adjust for inflation&rsquo;s impact.&nbsp;This way, it is possible to compare a country&rsquo;s GDP from one year to another and see if there is any real growth.</p><p>Real GDP is calculated using a&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gdppricedeflator.asp">GDP price deflator</a>, which is the difference in prices between the current year and the base year. For example, if prices rose by 5% since the base year, then the deflator would be 1.05. Nominal GDP is divided by this deflator, yielding real GDP. Nominal GDP is usually higher than real GDP because inflation is typically a positive number.</p><p>Real GDP accounts for changes in market value and thus narrows the difference between output figures from year to year. If there is a large discrepancy between a nation&rsquo;s real GDP and nominal GDP, this may be an indicator of significant inflation or deflation in its economy.</p><h3>GDP Per Capita</h3><p><aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/per-capita-gdp.asp">GDP per capita</a>&nbsp;is a measurement of the GDP per person in a country&rsquo;s population. It indicates that the amount of output or income per person in an economy can indicate average productivity or average living standards. GDP per capita can be stated in nominal, real (inflation-adjusted), or&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/updates/purchasing-power-parity-ppp/">purchasing power parity (PPP)</a>&nbsp;terms.</p><p>At a basic interpretation, per-capita GDP shows how much economic production value can be attributed to each individual citizen. This also translates to a measure of overall national wealth since GDP market value per person also readily serves as a prosperity measure.</p><p>Per-capita GDP is often analyzed alongside more traditional measures of GDP. Economists use this metric for insight into their own country&rsquo;s domestic productivity and the productivity of other countries. Per-capita GDP considers both a country&rsquo;s GDP and its population. Therefore, it can be important to understand how each factor contributes to the overall result and is affecting per-capita GDP growth.</p><p>If a country&rsquo;s per-capita GDP is growing with a stable population level, for example, it could be the result of technological progressions that are producing more with the same population level. Some countries may have a high per-capita GDP but a small population, which usually means they have built up a self-sufficient economy based on an abundance of special resources.</p><h3>GDP Growth Rate</h3><p>The&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economicgrowthrate.asp">GDP growth rate</a>&nbsp;compares the year-over-year (or quarterly) change in a country&rsquo;s economic output to measure how fast an economy is growing. Usually expressed as a percentage rate, this measure is popular for economic policymakers because GDP growth is thought to be closely connected to key policy targets such as inflation and unemployment rates.</p><p>If GDP growth rates accelerate, it may be a signal that the economy is&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/overheated_economy.asp">overheating</a>&nbsp;and the central bank may seek to raise interest rates. Conversely, central banks see a shrinking (or negative) GDP growth rate (i.e., a&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/recession.asp">recession</a>) as a signal that rates should be lowered and that stimulus may be necessary.</p><h3>GDP Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)</h3><p>While not directly a measure of GDP, economists look at PPP to see how one country&rsquo;s GDP measures up in international dollars using a method that adjusts for differences in local prices and costs of living to make cross-country comparisons of real output, real income, and living standards.</p><h2>GDP Formula</h2><p>GDP can be determined via three primary methods. All three methods should yield the same figure when correctly calculated. These three approaches are often termed the expenditure approach, the output (or production) approach, and the income approach.</p><h3>The Expenditure Approach</h3><p>The expenditure approach, also known as the spending approach, calculates spending by the different groups that participate in the economy. The U.S. GDP is primarily measured based on the expenditure approach. This approach can be calculated using the following formula:</p><p>GDP=C+G+I+NXwhere:C=ConsumptionG=Government&nbsp;spendingI=InvestmentNX=Net&nbsp;exports​GDP=C+G+I+NXwhere:C=ConsumptionG=Government&nbsp;spendingI=InvestmentNX=Net&nbsp;exports​</p><p>All of these activities contribute to the GDP of a country. Consumption refers to private consumption expenditures or&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumer-spending.asp">consumer spending</a>. Consumers spend money to acquire goods and services, such as groceries and haircuts. Consumer spending is the biggest component of GDP, accounting for more than two-thirds of the U.S. GDP.3</p><p>Consumer confidence, therefore, has a very significant bearing on&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/032415/what-are-some-ways-economic-growth-can-be-achieved.asp">economic growth</a>. A high confidence level indicates that consumers are willing to spend, while a low confidence level reflects uncertainty about the future and an unwillingness to spend.</p><p>Government spending represents government consumption expenditure and gross investment. Governments spend money on equipment, infrastructure, and payroll. Government spending may become more important relative to other components of a country&rsquo;s GDP when consumer spending and business investment both decline sharply. (This may occur in the wake of a recession, for example.)</p><p>Investment refers to private domestic investment or&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalexpenditure.asp">capital expenditures</a>. Businesses spend money to invest in their business activities. For example, a business may buy machinery. Business investment is a critical component of GDP since it increases the productive capacity of an economy and boosts employment levels.</p><p>The&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netexports.asp">net exports</a>&nbsp;formula subtracts total exports from total imports (NX = Exports - Imports). The goods and services that an economy makes that are exported to other countries, less the imports that are purchased by domestic consumers, represent a country&rsquo;s net exports. All expenditures by companies located in a given country, even if they are foreign companies, are included in this calculation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>The Production (Output) Approach</h3><p>The production approach is essentially the reverse of the expenditure approach. Instead of measuring the input costs that contribute to economic activity, the production approach estimates the total value of economic output and deducts the cost of&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intermediate-good.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">intermediate goods</a>&nbsp;that are consumed in the process (like those of materials and services). Whereas the expenditure approach projects forward from costs, the production approach looks backward from the vantage point of a state of completed economic activity.</p><h3>The Income Approach</h3><p>The income approach represents a kind of middle ground between the two other approaches to calculating GDP. The income approach calculates the income earned by all the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/factors-production.asp">factors of production</a>&nbsp;in an economy, including the wages paid to labor, the rent earned by land, the return on capital in the form of interest, and corporate profits.&nbsp;</p><p>The income approach factors in some adjustments for those items that are not considered payments made to factors of production. For one, there are some taxes&mdash;such as&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/salestax.asp">sales taxes</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/propertytax.asp">property taxes</a>&mdash;that are classified as indirect business taxes. In addition,&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depreciation.asp">depreciation</a>&mdash;a reserve that businesses set aside to account for the replacement of equipment that tends to wear down with use&mdash;is also added to the national income. All of this together constitutes a nation&rsquo;s income.</p><h2>GDP vs. GNP vs. GNI</h2><p>Although GDP is a widely used metric, there are other ways of measuring the economic growth of a country. While GDP measures the economic activity within the physical borders of&nbsp;a country (whether the producers are native to that country or foreign-owned entities),&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gnp.asp">gross national product (GNP)</a>&nbsp;is a measurement of the overall production of people or corporations native to a country, including those based abroad. GNP excludes domestic production by foreigners.</p><p><aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gross-national-income-gni.asp">Gross national income (GNI)</a>&nbsp;is another measure of economic growth. It is the sum of all income<strong>&nbsp;</strong>earned by citizens or nationals of a country (regardless of whether the underlying economic activity takes place domestically or abroad). The relationship between GNP and GNI is similar to the relationship between the production (output) approach and the income approach used to calculate GDP.</p><p>GNP uses the production approach, while GNI uses the income approach. With GNI, the income of a country is calculated as its domestic income, plus its indirect business taxes and depreciation (as well as its&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/net-foreign-factor-income-nffi.asp">net foreign factor income</a>). The figure for net foreign factor income is calculated by subtracting all payments made to foreign companies and individuals from all payments made to domestic businesses.</p><p>In an increasingly global economy, GNI has been put forward as a potentially better metric for overall economic health than GDP. Because certain countries have most of their income withdrawn abroad by foreign corporations and individuals, their GDP figure is much higher than the figure that represents their GNI.</p><p>For example, in 2019, Luxembourg had a significant difference between its GDP and GNI, mainly due to large payments made to the rest of the world via foreign corporations that did business in Luxembourg, attracted by the tiny nation&rsquo;s favorable tax laws.4&nbsp;On the contrary, in the U.S., GNI and GDP do not differ substantially. U.S. GDP was $25.7 trillion as of Q3-2022 while its GNI was $23.4 trillion at the end of 2021.56</p><h2>Adjustments to GDP</h2><p>A number of adjustments can be made to a country&rsquo;s GDP to improve the usefulness of this figure. For economists, a country&rsquo;s GDP reveals the size of the economy but provides little information about the standard of living in that country. Part of the reason for this is that population size and&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cost-of-living.asp">cost of living</a>&nbsp;are not consistent around the world.</p><p>For example, comparing the nominal GDP of China to the nominal GDP of Ireland would not provide much meaningful information about the realities of living in those countries because China has approximately 300 times the population of Ireland.</p><p>To help solve this problem, statisticians sometimes compare GDP&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/percapita.asp">per capita</a>&nbsp;between countries. GDP per capita is calculated by dividing a country&rsquo;s total GDP by its population, and this figure is frequently cited to assess the nation&rsquo;s standard of living. Even so, the measure is still imperfect.</p><p>Suppose China has a GDP per capita of $1,500, while Ireland has a GDP per capita of $15,000. This doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that the average Irish person is 10 times better off than the average Chinese person. GDP per capita doesn&rsquo;t account for how expensive it is to live in a country.</p><p>PPP attempts to solve this problem by comparing how many goods and services an exchange-rate-adjusted unit of money can purchase in different countries&mdash;comparing the price of an item, or basket of items, in two countries after adjusting for the exchange rate between the two, in effect.</p><p>Real per-capita GDP, adjusted for purchasing power parity, is a heavily refined statistic to measure true income, which is an important element of well-being. An individual in Ireland might make $100,000 a year, while an individual in China might make $50,000 a year. In nominal terms, the worker in Ireland is better off. But if a year&rsquo;s worth of food, clothing, and other items costs three times as much in Ireland as in China, however, then the worker in China has a higher&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/realincome.asp">real income</a>.</p><h2>How to Use GDP Data</h2><p>Most nations release GDP data every month and quarter. In the U.S., the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bea.asp">Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)</a>&nbsp;publishes an advance release of quarterly GDP four weeks after the quarter ends, and a final release three months after the quarter ends. The BEA releases are exhaustive and contain a wealth of detail, enabling economists and investors to obtain information and insights on various aspects of the economy.1</p><p>GDP&rsquo;s market impact is generally limited, since it is backward-looking, and a substantial amount of time has already elapsed between the quarter-end and GDP data release. However, GDP data can have an impact on markets if the actual numbers differ considerably from expectations.</p><p>Because GDP provides a direct indication of the health and growth of the economy, businesses can use GDP as a guide to their business strategy. Government entities, such as the Fed in the U.S., use the growth rate and other GDP stats as part of their decision process in determining what type of monetary policies to implement.</p><p>If the growth rate is slowing, they might implement an expansionary monetary policy to try to boost the economy. If the growth rate is robust, they might use monetary policy to slow things down to try to ward off inflation.</p><p>Real GDP is the indicator that says the most about the health of the economy. It is widely followed and discussed by economists, analysts, investors, and policymakers. The advance release of the latest data will almost always move markets, although that impact can be limited, as noted above.</p><h2>GDP and Investing</h2><p>Investors watch GDP since it provides a framework for decision-making. The corporate profits and inventory data in the GDP report are a great resource for equity investors, as both categories show total growth during the period; corporate profits data also displays pre-tax profits,&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operatingcashflow.asp">operating cash flows</a>, and breakdowns for all major sectors of the economy.</p><p>Comparing the GDP growth rates of different countries can play a part in asset allocation, aiding decisions about whether to invest in fast-growing economies abroad&mdash;and if so, which ones.</p><p>One interesting metric that investors can use to get some sense of the valuation of an equity market is the ratio of&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapgdp.asp">total market capitalization to GDP</a>, expressed as a percentage. The closest equivalent to this in terms of stock valuation is a company&rsquo;s market cap to total sales (or revenues), which in per-share terms is the well-known&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-to-salesratio.asp">price-to-sales ratio</a>.</p><p>Just as stocks in different sectors trade at widely divergent price-to-sales ratios, different nations trade at market-cap-to-GDP ratios that are literally all over the map. For example, according to the World Bank, the U.S. had a market-cap-to-GDP ratio of 195% for 2020, while China had a ratio of just over 83% and Hong Kong had a ratio of 1,777%.7</p><p>However, the utility of this ratio lies in comparing it to historical norms for a particular nation. As an example, the U.S. had a market-cap-to-GDP ratio of 142% at the end of 2006, which dropped to 79% by the end of 2008.7&nbsp;In retrospect, these represented zones of substantial overvaluation and undervaluation, respectively, for U.S. equities.</p><p>The biggest downside of this data is its lack of timeliness; investors only get one update per quarter, and revisions can be large enough to significantly alter the percentage change in GDP.</p><h2>History of GDP</h2><p>The concept of GDP was first proposed in 1937 in a report to the U.S. Congress in response to the Great Depression, conceived of and presented by an economist at the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nber.asp">National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)</a>, Simon Kuznets.8</p><p>At the time, the preeminent system of measurement was GNP. After the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brettonwoodsagreement.asp">Bretton Woods</a>&nbsp;conference in 1944, GDP was widely adopted as the standard means for measuring national economies; however, the U.S. continued to use GNP as its official measure of economic welfare until 1991, after which it switched to GDP.8</p><p>Beginning in the 1950s, however, some economists and policymakers began to question GDP. Some observed, for example, a tendency to accept GDP as an absolute indicator of a nation&rsquo;s failure or success, despite its failure to account for health, happiness, (in)equality, and other constituent factors of public welfare. In other words, these critics drew attention to a distinction between economic progress and social progress.</p><p>However, most authorities, like&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/okunslaw.asp">Arthur Okun</a>, an economist for President John F. Kennedy&rsquo;s Council of Economic Advisers, held firm to the belief that GDP is an absolute indicator of economic success, claiming that for every increase in GDP, there would be a corresponding drop in unemployment.9</p><h2>Criticisms of GDP</h2><p>There are, of course, drawbacks to using GDP as an indicator. In addition to the lack of timeliness, some criticisms of GDP as a measure are:</p><ul>	<li><strong>It ignores the value of informal or unrecorded economic activity.</strong>&nbsp;GDP relies on recorded transactions and official data, so it does not take into account the extent of informal economic activity. GDP fails to account for the value of under-the-table employment, underground&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blackmarket.asp">market</a>&nbsp;activity, or unremunerated volunteer work, which can all be significant in some nations and cannot account for the value of leisure time or household production, which are ubiquitous conditions of human life in all societies.</li>	<li><strong>It is geographically limited in a globally open economy.</strong>&nbsp;GDP does not take into account profits earned in a nation by overseas companies that are remitted back to foreign investors. This can overstate a country&rsquo;s actual economic output. For example, Ireland had a GDP of almost $499 billion and GNI of $372 billion in 2021, the difference of about $127 billion (or over 25% of GDP) largely being due to profit&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/repatriation.asp">repatriation</a>&nbsp;by foreign companies based in Ireland.1011</li>	<li><strong>It emphasizes material output without considering overall well-being.</strong>&nbsp;GDP growth alone cannot measure a nation&rsquo;s development or its citizens&rsquo; well-being, as noted above. For instance, a nation may be experiencing rapid GDP growth, but this may impose a significant cost to society in terms of environmental impact and an increase in income disparity.</li>	<li><strong>It ignores business-to-business activity.&nbsp;</strong>GDP considers only final goods production and new capital investment and deliberately nets out intermediate spending and transactions between businesses. By doing so, GDP overstates the importance of consumption relative to production in the economy and is less sensitive as an indicator of economic fluctuations compared to metrics that include business-to-business activity.</li>	<li><strong>It counts costs and waste as economic benefits.</strong>&nbsp;GDP counts all final private and government spending as additions to income and output for society, regardless of whether they are actually productive or profitable. This means that obviously unproductive or even destructive activities are routinely counted as economic output and contribute to growth in GDP. For example, this includes spending directed toward extracting or transferring wealth between members of society rather than producing wealth (such as the administrative costs of taxation or money spent on lobbying and&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rentseeking.asp">rent-seeking</a>); spending on investment projects for which the necessary complementary goods and labor are not available or for which actual consumer demand does not exist (such as the construction of empty ghost cities or bridges to nowhere, unconnected to any road network); and spending on goods and services that are either themselves destructive or only necessary to offset other destructive activities, rather than to create new wealth (such as the production of weapons of war or spending on policing and anti-crime measures).</li></ul><h2>Global Sources for Country GDP Data</h2><p><aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/worldbank.asp">The World Bank</a>&nbsp;hosts one of the most reliable web-based databases. It has one of the best and most comprehensive lists of countries for which it tracks GDP data. The&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/imf.asp">International Money Fund (IMF)</a>&nbsp;also provides GDP data through its multiple databases, such as World Economic Outlook and International Financial Statistics.1213</p><p>Another highly reliable source of GDP data is the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/oecd.asp">Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)</a>. The OECD not only provides historical data but also forecasts GDP growth. The disadvantage of using the OECD database is that it tracks only OECD member countries and a few nonmember countries.</p><p>In the U.S., the Fed collects data from multiple sources, including a country&rsquo;s statistical agencies and The World Bank. The only drawback to using a Fed database is a lack of updating in GDP data and an absence of data for certain countries.</p><p>The BEA is a division of the U.S.&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/department-of-commerce.asp">Department of Commerce</a>. It issues its own analysis document with each GDP release, which is a great investor tool for analyzing figures and trends and reading highlights of the very lengthy full release.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>What Is a Simple Definition of GDP?</h2><p>Gross domestic product is a measurement that seeks to capture a country&rsquo;s economic output. Countries with larger GDPs will have a greater amount of goods and services generated within them, and will generally have a higher standard of living. For this reason, many citizens and political leaders see GDP growth as an important measure of national success, often referring to GDP growth and economic growth interchangeably. Due to various limitations, however, many economists have argued that GDP should not be used as a proxy for overall economic success, much less the success of a society.</p><h2>Which Country Has the Highest GDP?</h2><p>The countries with the two highest GDPs in the world are the United States and China. However, their ranking differs depending on how you measure GDP. Using nominal GDP, the United States comes in first with a GDP of $23 trillion as of 2022, compared to $17.7 trillion in China.1415</p><p>But many economists argue that it is more accurate to instead use purchasing power parity GDP as a measure of national wealth. By this metric, China is actually the world leader with a 2021 PPP GDP of $27.3 trillion, followed by $23 trillion in the United States.1617</p><h2>Is a High GDP Good?</h2><p>Most people perceive a higher GDP to be a good thing because it is associated with greater economic opportunities and an improved standard of material well-being. It is possible, however, for a country to have a high GDP and still be an unattractive place to live, so it is important to also consider other measurements. For example, a country could have a high GDP and a low&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/per-capita-gdp.asp">per-capita GDP</a>, suggesting that significant wealth exists but is concentrated in the hands of very few people. One way to address this is to look at GDP alongside another measure of economic development, such as the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/human-development-index-hdi.asp">Human Development Index (HDI)</a>.</p><h2>The Bottom Line</h2><p>In their seminal textbook&nbsp;<em>Economics</em>,&nbsp;Paul Samuelson and William&nbsp;Nordhaus neatly sum up the importance of the national accounts and GDP. They liken the ability of GDP to give an overall picture of the state of the economy to that of a satellite in space that can survey the weather across an entire continent.</p><p>GDP enables policymakers and central banks to judge whether the economy is contracting or expanding, whether it needs a boost or restraint, and if a threat such as a recession or inflation looms on the horizon. Like any measure, GDP has its imperfections. In recent decades, governments have created various nuanced modifications in attempts to increase GDP accuracy and specificity. Means of calculating GDP have also evolved continually since its conception to keep up with evolving measurements of industry activity and the generation and consumption of new, emerging forms of intangible assets.</p>`,

       `<h1>Law of Supply and Demand in Economics: How It Works</h1><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>What Is the Law of Supply and Demand?</h2><p>The law of supply and demand combines two fundamental economic principles describing how changes in the price of a resource, commodity, or product affect its supply and demand.</p><p>As the price increases, supply rises while demand declines. Conversely, as the price drops supply constricts while demand grows.</p><p>Levels of supply and demand for varying prices can be plotted on a graph as curves. The intersection of these curves marks the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equilibrium.asp">equilibrium</a>, or&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/clearingprice.asp">market-clearing price</a>&nbsp;at which demand equals supply, and represents the process of&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pricediscovery.asp">price discovery</a>&nbsp;in the marketplace.</p><h3>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h3><ul>	<li>The law of demand holds that the demand level for a product or a resource will decline as its price rises, and rise as the price drops.</li>	<li>Conversely, the law of supply says higher prices boost supply of an economic good while lower ones tend to diminish it.</li>	<li>A market-clearing price balances supply and demand, and can be graphically represented as the intersection of the supply and demand curves.</li>	<li>The degree to which changes in price translate into changes in demand and supply is known as the product&#39;s price elasticity. Demand for basic necessities is relatively inelastic, meaning it is less responsive to changes in their price.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Understanding the Law of Supply and Demand</h2><p>It may seem obvious that in any sale&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/transaction.asp">transaction</a>&nbsp;the price satisfies both the buyer and the seller, matching supply with demand. The interactions between supply, demand, and price in a (more or less) free marketplace have been observed for thousands of years.1</p><p>Many medieval thinkers, like modern day critics of market pricing for select commodities, distinguished between a &quot;just&quot; price based on costs and equitable returns and one at which the sale was in fact transacted.2&nbsp;Our understanding of price as a signaling mechanism matching supply and demand is&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/030415/who-discovered-law-supply-and-demand.asp">rooted in the work of Enlightenment economists</a>&nbsp;who studied and summarized the relationship.</p><p>Importantly, supply and demand do not necessarily respond to price movements proportionally. The degree to which price changes affect the product&#39;s demand or supply is known as its price elasticity. Products with a high&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/priceelasticity.asp">price elasticity of demand</a>&nbsp;will see wider fluctuations in demand based on the price. In contrast, basic necessities will be relatively inelastic in price because people can&#39;t easily do without them, meaning demand will change less relative to changes in the price.</p><p>Price discovery based on supply and demand curves assumes a marketplace in which buyers and sellers are free to transact or not, depending on the price. Factors such as taxes and government regulation, the market power of suppliers, the availability of substitute goods, and economic cycles can all shift the supply or demand curves or alter their shapes. But so long as buyers and sellers retain agency, the commodities affected by these external factors remain subject to the fundamental forces of supply and demand. Now let&#39;s consider in turn how demand and supply respond to price changes.</p><h2>The Law of Demand</h2><p>The&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lawofdemand.asp">law of demand</a>&nbsp;holds that demand for a product changes inversely to its price, all else being equal. In other words, the higher the price, the lower the level of demand.</p><p>Because buyers have finite resources, their spending on a given product or commodity is limited as well, so higher prices reduce the quantity demanded. Conversely, demand rises as the product becomes more affordable.</p><p>As a result, demand curves slope downward from left to right, as in the chart below. Changes in demand levels as a function of a product&#39;s price relative to buyers&#39; income or resources are known as the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incomeeffect.asp">income effect</a>.</p><p>Naturally, there are exceptions. One is&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/giffen-good.asp">Giffen goods</a>, typically low-priced staples also known as&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inferior-good.asp">inferior goods</a>. Inferior goods are those that see a drop in demand when incomes rise because consumers trade up to higher-quality products. But when the price of an inferior good rises and demand goes up because consumers use more of it in place of costlier alternatives, the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/substitution-effect.asp">substitution effect</a>&nbsp;turns the product into a Giffen good.</p><p>At the opposite end of the income and wealth spectrum,&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/veblen-good.asp">Veblen goods</a>&nbsp;are luxury goods that gain in value and consequently generate higher demand levels as they rise in price because the price of these luxury goods signals (and may even increase) the owner&#39;s status. Veblen goods are named for economist and sociologist&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/thorstein-veblen.asp">Thorstein Veblen</a>, who developed the concept and coined the term &quot;conspicuous consumption&quot; to describe it.</p><h2>The Law of Supply</h2><p>The&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lawofsupply.asp">law of supply</a>&nbsp;relates price changes for a product with the quantity supplied. In contrast with the law of demand the law of supply relationship is direct, not inverse. The higher the price, the higher the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quantitysupplied.asp">quantity supplied</a>. Lower prices mean reduced supply, all else held equal.</p><p>Higher prices give suppliers an incentive to supply more of the product or commodity, assuming their costs aren&#39;t increasing as much. Lower prices result in a&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marginpressure.asp">cost squeeze</a>&nbsp;that curbs supply. As a result, supply slopes are upwardly sloping from left to right.</p><p>As with demand, supply constraints may limit the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040615/how-does-price-elasticity-affect-supply.asp">price elasticity of supply</a>&nbsp;for a product, while&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/supplyshock.asp">supply shocks</a>&nbsp;may cause a disproportionate price change for an essential commodity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Equilibrium Price</h2><p>Also called a market-clearing price, the equilibrium price is the price at which demand matches supply, producing a market equilibrium acceptable to buyers and sellers.</p><p>At the point where an upward-sloping supply curve and a downward-sloping demand curve intersect, supply and demand in terms of the quantity of the goods are balanced, leaving no surplus supply or unmet demand. The level of the market-clearing price depends on the shape and position of the respective supply and demand curves, which are influenced by numerous factors.&nbsp;</p><h2>Factors Affecting Supply</h2><p>In industries where suppliers are not willing to lose money, supply will tend to decline toward zero at product prices below&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/production-cost.asp">production costs</a>.</p><p>Price elasticity will also depend on the number of sellers, their aggregate productive capacity, how easily it can be lowered or increased, and the industry&#39;s&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040915/what-difference-between-monopolistic-market-and-perfect-competition.asp">competitive dynamics</a>. Taxes and regulations may matter as well.</p><h2>Factors Affecting Demand</h2><p>Consumer income, preferences, and willingness to substitute one product for another are among the most important determinants of demand.</p><p>Consumer preferences will depend, in part, on a product&#39;s&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market-penetration.asp">market penetration</a>, since the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marginalutility.asp">marginal utility</a>&nbsp;of goods&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lawofdiminishingutility.asp">diminishes</a>&nbsp;as the quantity owned increases. The first car is more life-altering than the fifth addition to the fleet; the living-room TV more useful than the fourth one for the garage.</p><h2>What Is a Simple Explanation of the Law of Supply and Demand?</h2><p>If you&#39;ve ever wondered how the supply of a product matches demand, or how market prices are set, the law of supply and demand holds the answers. Higher prices cause supply to increase while demand drops. Lower prices boost demand while limiting supply. The market-clearing price is one at which supply and demand are balanced.</p><h2>Why Is the Law of Supply and Demand Important?</h2><p>The Law of Supply and Demand is essential because it helps investors, entrepreneurs, and economists understand and predict market conditions. For example, a company considering a price hike on a product will typically expect demand for it to decline as a result, and will attempt to estimate the price elasticity and substitution effect to determine whether to proceed regardless.</p><h2>What Is an Example of the Law of Supply and Demand?</h2><p>When gasoline consumption plunged with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, prices quickly followed suit because the industry ran out of storage space. The price decline, in turn, served as a powerful signal to suppliers to curb gasoline production. Conversely, crude oil prices in 2022 provided producers with additional incentive to boost output.</p>`,

      articleText:
        `<h2>What Is Unemployment?</h2><p>The term unemployment refers to a situation where a person actively&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0711/9-different-ways-to-find-a-new-job.aspx">searches for employment</a>&nbsp;but is unable to find work. Unemployment is considered to be a key measure of the health of the economy.</p><p>The most frequently used measure of unemployment is the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unemploymentrate.asp">unemployment rate</a>. It&#39;s calculated by dividing the number of unemployed people by the number of people in the labor force.</p><p>Many governments offer unemployment insurance to certain unemployed individuals who meet eligibility requirements.</p><h3>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h3><ul>	<li>Unemployment occurs when workers who want to work are unable to find jobs.</li>	<li>High rates of unemployment signal economic distress while extremely low rates of unemployment may signal an overheated economy.</li>	<li>Unemployment can be classified as frictional, cyclical, structural, or institutional.</li>	<li>Unemployment data is collected and published by government agencies in a variety of ways.</li>	<li>Many governments offer unemployed individuals a small amount of income through unemployment insurance, as long as they meet certain requirements.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Understanding Unemployment</h2><p>Unemployment is a key economic&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indicator.asp">indicator</a>&nbsp;because it signals the ability (or inability) of workers to obtain gainful work and contribute to the productive output of the economy. More unemployed workers mean less total economic production.</p><p>The unemployment definition doesn&#39;t include people who leave the workforce for reasons such as retirement, higher education, and disability.</p><h3>Sign of Economic Distress</h3><p>Unemployed workers must maintain at least subsistence consumption during their period of unemployment. This means that an economy with high unemployment has lower output without a proportional decline in the need for basic consumption.</p><p>High, persistent unemployment can signal serious distress in an&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economy.asp">economy</a>&nbsp;and even lead to social and political upheaval.</p><h3>Sign of Overheating Economy</h3><p>A low unemployment rate, on the other hand, means that the economy is more likely to be producing near its full&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capacity.asp">capacity</a>, maximizing output, driving wage growth, and raising&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standard-of-living.asp">living standards</a>&nbsp;over time.</p><p>However, extremely low unemployment can also be a cautionary sign of an overheating economy, inflationary pressures, and tight conditions for businesses in need of additional workers.</p><h3>Categories of Unemployment</h3><p>While the definition of unemployment is clear, economists divide unemployment into many different categories. The two broadest categories are voluntary and involuntary unemployment. When unemployment is voluntary, it means that a person left their job willingly in search of other employment. When it is involuntary, it means that a person was fired or laid off and&nbsp;must now look for another job.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Types of Unemployment</h2><p>Unemployment&mdash;both voluntary and involuntary&mdash;can be broken down into four types.</p><h3>Frictional Unemployment</h3><p>This type of unemployment is usually short-lived. It is also the least problematic from an economic standpoint. It occurs when people voluntarily change jobs. After a person leaves a company, it naturally takes time to find another job. Similarly, graduates just starting to look for jobs to enter the workforce add to frictional unemployment.</p><p><aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/frictionalunemployment.asp">Frictional unemployment</a>&nbsp;is a natural result of the fact that market processes take time and information can be costly. Searching for a new job, recruiting new workers, and matching the right workers to the right jobs all take time and effort. This results in frictional unemployment.</p><h3>Cyclical Unemployment</h3><p><aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cyclicalunemployment.asp">Cyclical unemployment</a>&nbsp;is the variation in the number of unemployed workers over the course of economic upturns and downturns, such as those related to&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/032515/how-oil-prices-impact-us-economy.asp">changes in oil prices</a>. Unemployment rises during&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/recession.asp">recessionary</a>&nbsp;periods and declines during periods of economic growth.</p><p>Preventing and alleviating cyclical unemployment during recessions is one of the key reasons for the study of economics and the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/negative-interest-rate-policy-nirp.asp">various policy tools</a>&nbsp;that governments employ to stimulate the economy on the downside of business cycles.</p><h3>Structural Unemployment</h3><p><aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/structuralunemployment.asp">Structural unemployment</a>&nbsp;comes about through a technological change in the structure of the economy in which labor markets operate. Technological changes can lead to unemployment among workers displaced from jobs that are no longer needed. Examples of such changes include the replacement of horse-drawn transport with automobiles and the automation of manufacturing,</p><p>Retraining these workers can be difficult, costly, and time-consuming. Displaced workers often end up either unemployed for extended periods or leaving the labor force entirely.</p><h3>Institutional Unemployment</h3><p>Institutional unemployment results from long-term or permanent institutional factors and incentives in the economy. The following can all contribute to institutional unemployment:</p><ul>	<li>Government policies, such as high&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/minimum_wage.asp">minimum wage</a>&nbsp;floors, generous social benefits programs, and restrictive occupational licensing laws</li>	<li>Labor market phenomena, such as&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/efficiency-wages-5206757">efficiency wages</a>&nbsp;and discriminatory hiring</li>	<li>Labor market institutions, such as high rates of unionization</li></ul><h2>How to Measure Unemployment</h2><p>In the United States, the government uses surveys, census counts, and the number of&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unemployment-insurance.asp">unemployment insurance</a>&nbsp;claims to track unemployment.</p><p>The U.S. Census conducts a monthly survey called the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentpopulationsurvey.asp">Current Population Survey</a>&nbsp;(CPS) on behalf of the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bls.asp">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>&nbsp;(BLS) to produce the primary estimate of the nation&rsquo;s unemployment rate. This survey has been done every month since 1940.1</p><p>The sample consists of about 60,000 eligible households. That translates to about 110,000 people each month. The Census changes a quarter of the sampled households each month so that no household is represented for more than four consecutive months. This is meant to strengthen the reliability of the estimates.1</p><p>Many variations of the unemployment rate exist, with different definitions of who is an unemployed person and who is in the labor force.</p><p>The BLS&nbsp;commonly cites the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/080415/true-unemployment-rate-u6-vs-u3.asp">U-3 unemployment rate</a>&nbsp;(defined as the total unemployed as a percentage of the civilian labor force) as the official unemployment rate; however, this definition does not include discouraged unemployed workers who are no longer looking for work.2</p><p>Other categories of unemployment include discouraged workers and part-time or underemployed workers who want to work full-time but, for economic reasons, are unable to do so.</p><h2>History of Unemployment</h2><p>Although the U.S. government began tracking unemployment in the 1940s, the highest rate of unemployment to date occurred during the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great_depression.asp">Great Depression</a>, when unemployment rose to 24.9% in 1933.</p><p>Between 1931 and 1940, the unemployment rate remained above 14% but subsequently dropped down to the single digits. It remained there until 1982 when it climbed above 10%.34</p><p>In 2009, during the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great-recession.asp">Great Recession</a>, unemployment again rose to 10%. In April 2020, amid the Coronavirus pandemic, unemployment hit 14.8%. As of February 2023, the unemployment rate was 3.6%, up 0.2% from the previous month.567</p><h2>What Are the Main Causes of Unemployment?</h2><p>There are a number of reasons for unemployment. These include recessions, depressions, technological improvements, job outsourcing, and voluntarily leaving one job to find another.</p><h2>What Are the 3 Types of Unemployment?</h2><p>Today&#39;s economists point to three main types of unemployment: frictional, structural, and cyclical. Frictional unemployment is the result of voluntary employment transitions within an economy. Frictional unemployment naturally occurs, even in a growing, stable economy as workers change jobs. Structural unemployment can produce permanent disruptions due to fundamental and permanent changes that occur in the structure of the economy. These changes can marginalize a group of workers. They include technological changes, a lack of relevant skills, and jobs moving overseas to another country. Cyclical unemployment relates to the loss of jobs that occurs during changes in business cycles.</p><h2>What Is the Strict Definition of Unemployment?</h2><p>The official unemployment definition comes from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which states that &quot;people are classified as unemployed if they do not have a job, have actively looked for work in the prior four weeks, and are currently available for work.&quot;1</p><h2>The Bottom Line</h2><p>Unemployment is when an individual who is not employed and is seeking employment, cannot find work. Unemployment is a key indicator of the health of an economy. A low unemployment rate represents a strong economy while a high unemployment rate represents a weak economy.</p>`,

        `<h1>Utility in Economics Explained: Types and Measurement</h1><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>What Is Utility?</h2><p>In economics, utility is a term used to determine the worth or value of a good or service. More specifically, utility is the total satisfaction or benefit derived from consuming a good or service. Economic theories based on rational choice usually assume that consumers will strive to maximize their utility.</p><p>The economic utility of a good or service is important to understand because it directly influences the demand, and therefore price, of that good or service. In practice, a consumer&#39;s utility is usually impossible to measure or quantify. However, some economists believe that they can indirectly estimate what is the utility of an economic good or service by employing various models.</p><h3>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h3><ul>	<li>Utility, in economics, refers to the usefulness or enjoyment a consumer can get from a service or good.</li>	<li>Although the concept of utility is abstract, it is a useful way to explain how and why consumers make their decisions.</li>	<li>&quot;Ordinal&quot; utility refers to the concept of one good being more useful or desirable than another.</li>	<li>&quot;Cardinal&quot; utility is the idea of measuring economic value through imaginary units, known as &quot;utils.&quot;</li>	<li>Marginal utility is the utility gained by consuming an additional unit of a service or good.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Understanding Utility</h2><p>The utility definition in economics is derived from the concept of usefulness. An economic good yields utility to the extent to which it&#39;s useful for satisfying a consumer&rsquo;s want or need.1&nbsp;Various schools of thought differ as to how to model economic utility and measure the usefulness of a good or service.</p><p>Utility in economics was first coined by the noted 18th-century Swiss mathematician Daniel Bernoulli.2&nbsp;Since then, economic theory has progressed, leading to various types of economic utility.</p><h2>Ordinal Utility</h2><p>Early economists of the Spanish Scholastic tradition of the 1300s and 1400s described the economic value of goods as deriving directly from this property of usefulness and based their theories on prices and monetary exchanges.</p><p>This conception of utility was not quantified, but a qualitative property of an economic good.3&nbsp;Later economists, particularly those of the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/austrian_school.asp">Austrian School</a>, developed this idea into an ordinal theory of utility, or the idea that individuals could order or rank the usefulness of various discrete units of economic goods.4</p><p>Austrian economist Carl Menger, in a discovery known as the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/economic-thought.asp#toc-the-marginal-revolution">marginal revolution</a>, used this type of framework to help him resolve the diamond-water paradox that had vexed many previous economists. Because the first available units of any economic good will be put to the most highly valued uses, and subsequent units go to lower-valued uses, this ordinal theory of utility is useful for explaining the law of diminishing marginal utility and fundamental economic&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/law-of-supply-demand.asp">laws of supply and demand</a>.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Cardinal Utility</h2><p>To Bernoulli and other economists, utility is modeled as a quantifiable or cardinal property of the economic goods that a person consumes.2&nbsp;To help with this quantitative measurement of satisfaction, economists assume a unit known as a &ldquo;util&rdquo; to represent the amount of psychological satisfaction a specific good or service generates for a subset of people in various situations.5&nbsp;The concept of a measurable util makes it possible to treat economic theory and relationships using mathematical symbols and calculations.</p><p>However, it separates the theory of economic utility from actual observation and experience, since &ldquo;utils&rdquo; cannot actually be observed, measured, or compared between different economic goods or between individuals.6</p><p>If, for example, an individual judges that a piece of pizza will yield 10 utils and that a bowl of pasta will yield 12 utils, that individual will know that eating the pasta will be more satisfying. For the producers of pizza and pasta, knowing that the average bowl of pasta will yield two additional utils will help them price pasta slightly higher than pizza.</p><p>Additionally, utils can decrease as the number of products or services consumed increases. The first slice of pizza may yield 10 utils, but as more pizza is consumed, the utils may decrease as people become full. This process will help consumers understand how to maximize their utility by allocating their money between multiple types of goods and services as well as help companies understand how to structure tiered pricing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Economic utility can be estimated by observing a consumer&#39;s choice between similar products. However, measuring utility becomes challenging as more variables or differences are present between the choices.6</p><h2>Total Utility</h2><p>If utility in economics is cardinal and measurable, the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/totalutility.asp">total utility</a>&nbsp;(TU) is defined as the sum of the satisfaction that a person can receive from the consumption of all units of a specific product or service.1&nbsp;Using the example above, if a person can only consume three slices of pizza and the first slice of pizza consumed yields ten utils, the second slice of pizza consumed yields eight utils, and the third slice yields two utils, the total utility of pizza would be twenty utils.</p><h2>Marginal Utility</h2><p><aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marginalutility.asp">Marginal utility</a>&nbsp;(MU) is defined as the additional (cardinal) utility gained from the consumption of one additional unit of a good or service or the additional (ordinal) use that a person has for an additional unit.1</p><p>Using the same example, if the economic utility of the first slice of pizza is ten utils and the utility of the second slice is eight utils, the MU of eating the second slice is eight utils. If the utility of a third slice is two utils, the MU of eating that third slice is two utils.</p><p>In ordinal utility terms, a person might eat the first slice of pizza, share the second slice with their roommate, save the third slice for breakfast, and use the fourth slice as a doorstop.</p><h2>How Do You Measure Economic Utility?</h2><p>While there is no direct way to measure the utility of a certain good for an individual consumer, it is possible to estimate utility through indirect observation. For example, if a consumer is willing to spend $1 for a bottle of water but not $1.50, economists can safely state that a bottle of water has economic utility somewhere between $1 and $1.50. However, this becomes difficult in practice because of the number of variables that are present in a typical consumer&#39;s choices.</p><h2>What Are the 4 Types of Economic Utility?</h2><p>In&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/behavioraleconomics.asp">behavioral economics</a>, the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/032615/what-are-four-types-economic-utility.asp">four types of economic utility</a>&nbsp;are form utility, time utility, place utility, and possession utility. These terms refer to the psychological importance attached to different forms of utility. For example, form utility is the result of the design of a product or service, and time utility refers to the ability of a company to provide services when the customers need them.</p><h2>How Do You Invest in Utilities?</h2><p><aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/utilities_sector.asp">Utilities</a>&nbsp;are companies that operate in the electric, water, oil, or gas sectors. These companies play a major role in industrial economies and have a total market capitalization of nearly $1.6 trillion. In addition to investing in individual companies, there are also many targeted funds that are invested in a basket of utilities-sector companies.</p><h2>The Bottom Line</h2><p>Utility can be used to measure the usefulness of goods and services to consumers. While there are limitations when more variables and differences appear in the market, various types of economic utility continue to be examined. Not only can it help companies with structuring their tiered pricing but it can also help consumers learn how to boost the utility of their purchases.</p>`,

       `<h1>Monopoly vs. Oligopoly: What&#39;s the Difference?</h1><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Monopoly vs. Oligopoly: An Overview</h2><p>A&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monopoly.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">monopoly</a>&nbsp;and an&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/oligopoly.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">oligopoly</a>&nbsp;are market structures that exist when there is imperfect competition. A monopoly is when a single company produces goods with no close substitute, while an oligopoly is when a small number of relatively large companies produce similar, but slightly different goods. In both cases, significant barriers to entry prevent other enterprises from competing.</p><p>A market&#39;s geographical size can&nbsp;determine&nbsp;which structure exists. One company might control an industry in a particular area with no other alternatives, though a few similar companies operate elsewhere in the country. In this case, a company may be a monopoly in one region, but operate in an oligopoly&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">market</a>&nbsp;in a larger geographical area.</p><h3>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h3><ul>	<li>A monopoly occurs when a single company that produces a product or service controls the market with no close substitute.</li>	<li>In an oligopoly, two or more companies control the market, none of which can keep the others from having significant influence.&nbsp;</li>	<li>Anti-trust laws prevent companies from engaging in unreasonable restraint of trade and transacting mergers that lessen competition.1﻿</li></ul><h2>Monopoly</h2><p>A monopoly exists in areas where one company is the only or dominant force to sell a product or service in an&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/industry.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">industry</a>. This gives the company enough power to keep competitors away from the marketplace. This could be due to high&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/barrierstoentry.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">barriers to entry</a>&nbsp;such as technology, steep&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">capital</a>&nbsp;requirements, government regulation, patents or&nbsp;high distribution costs.</p><p>Once a monopoly is established, lack of competition can lead the seller to charge high prices. Monopolies are price makers. This means they determine the cost at which their products are sold. These prices can be changed at any time. A monopoly also reduces available choices for buyers. The monopoly becomes a pure monopoly when there is absolutely no other substitute available.</p><p>Monopolies are allowed to exist when they benefit the consumer. In some cases, governments may step in and create the monopoly to provide specific services such as a railway, public transport or postal services. For example, the United States Postal Service enjoys a monopoly on first class mail and advertising mail, along with monopoly access to mailboxes.2﻿</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The United States Postal Service enjoys a monopoly on letter carrying and access to mailboxes that is protected by the Constitution.2﻿</p><h2>Oligopoly</h2><p>In an oligopoly, a group of companies (usually two or more) controls the market. However, no single company can keep the others from wielding significant influence over the industry, and they each may sell products that are slightly different.</p><p>Prices in this market are moderate because of the presence of competition. When one company sets a price, others will respond in fashion to remain competitive. For example, if one company cuts prices, other players typically follow suit. Prices are usually higher in an oligopoly than they would be in&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/perfectcompetition.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">perfect competition</a>.</p><p>Because there is no dominant force in the industry, companies may be tempted to collude with one another rather than compete, which keeps non-established players from entering the market. This cooperation makes them operate as though they were a single company.</p><p>In 2012, the U.S. Department of Justice alleged that Apple (<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=AAPL" rel="noopener noreferrer">AAPL</a>) and five book publishers had engaged in&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/collusion.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">collusion</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixing.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">price fixing</a>&nbsp;for e-books. The department alleged that Apple and the publishers conspired to raise the price for e-book downloads from $9.99 to $14.99.3﻿ A U.S. District Court sided with the government, a decision which was upheld on appeal.4﻿</p><p>In a free market, price fixing&mdash;even without judicial intervention&mdash;is unsustainable. If one company&nbsp;undermines its competition, others are forced to quickly follow. Companies that lower prices to the point where they are not profitable are unable to remain in business for long. Because of this, members of oligopolies tend to compete in terms of image and quality rather than price.</p><h2>Legalities of Monopolies vs. Oligopolies</h2><p>Oligopolies and monopolies can operate unencumbered in the United States unless they violate anti-trust laws. These laws cover unreasonable restraint of trade; plainly harmful acts such as price fixing, dividing markets and bid rigging; and&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mergersandacquisitions.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A)</a>&nbsp;that substantially lessen competition.1﻿</p><p>Without competition, companies have the power to fix prices and create product scarcity, which can lead to inferior products and services and higher costs for buyers. Anti-trust laws are in place to ensure a level playing field.</p><p>In 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a civil antitrust suit to block AT&amp;T&#39;s&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/merger.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">merger</a>&nbsp;with Time Warner, arguing the acquisition would substantially lessen competition and lead to higher prices for television programming.5﻿ However, a U.S. District Court judge disagreed with the government&#39;s argument and approved the merger, a decision that was upheld on appeal.6﻿</p><p>The government has several tools to fight monopolistic behavior. This includes the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sherman-antiturst-act.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sherman Antitrust Act</a>, which prohibits unreasonable restraint of trade, and the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/clayton-antitrust-act.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clayton Antitrust Act</a>, which prohibits mergers that lessen competition and requires large companies that plan to merge to seek approval in advance.1﻿ Anti-trust laws do not sanction companies that achieve monopoly status via offering a better product or service, or though uncontrollable developments such as a key competitor leaving the market.</p><h2>Examples of Monopolies and Oligopolies</h2><p>A company with a new or innovative product or service enjoys a monopoly until competitors emerge. Sometimes these new products are protected by law. For example,&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/06/drugmarket.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">pharmaceutical companies</a>&nbsp;in the U.S. are granted&nbsp;20 years of exclusivity on new drugs.7﻿ This is necessary due to the time and capital required to develop and bring new drugs to market. Without this protected status, firms would not be able to realize a return on their&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">investment</a>, and potentially beneficial research would be stifled.</p><p>Gas and electric utilities are also granted monopolies. However, these utilities are heavily regulated by state public utility commissions. Rates are often controlled, along with any rate increases the company may pass onto consumers.</p><p>Oligopolies exist throughout the business world. A handful of companies control the market for mass media and entertainment. Some of the big names include The Walt Disney Company (<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=dis" rel="noopener noreferrer">DIS</a>), ViacomCBS (<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=viac" rel="noopener noreferrer">VIAC</a>) and Comcast (<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=CMCSA" rel="noopener noreferrer">CMCSA</a>). In the music business, Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group have a tight grip on the market.</p>`,

        `<h1>What Is a Surplus? Definition, Reasons, and Consequences</h1><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>What Is a Surplus?</h2><p>A surplus describes the amount of an asset or resource that exceeds the portion that&#39;s actively utilized. A surplus can refer to a host of different items, including income, profits, capital, and goods. In the context of inventories, a surplus describes products that remain sitting on store shelves, unpurchased. In budgetary contexts, a surplus occurs when income earned exceeds expenses paid. A&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/budget-surplus.asp">budget surplus</a>&nbsp;can also occur within governments when there&#39;s leftover tax revenue after all government programs are fully financed.</p><h3>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h3><ul>	<li>A surplus describes a level of an asset that exceeds the portion used.&nbsp;</li>	<li>An inventory surplus occurs when products remain unsold.</li>	<li>Budgetary surpluses occur when income earned exceeds expenses paid.</li>	<li>A surplus results from a disconnect between supply and demand for a product, or when some people are willing to pay more for a product than other consumers.</li>	<li>Typically, a surplus causes a market disequilibrium&nbsp;in the supply and demand of a product. This imbalance can sometimes mean that the product cannot efficiently flow through the market.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Understanding a Surplus</h2><p>A surplus isn&#39;t necessarily desirable. For example, a manufacturer who over-projects future demand for a given product may create too many unsold units, which may consequently contribute to quarterly or annual financial losses. A surplus of perishable commodities like grains could cause a permanent loss, as inventory spoils and the items become unsellable.</p><h2>Economic Surplus</h2><p>There are two types of economic surplus:&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumer_surplus.asp">consumer surplus</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/producer_surplus.asp">producer surplus</a>. As a rule, consumer surplus and producer surplus are&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutuallyexclusive.asp">mutually exclusive</a>, in that what&#39;s good for one is bad for the other.</p><h3>Consumer Surplus</h3><p>A consumer surplus occurs when the price for a product or service is lower than the highest price a consumer would willingly pay. Think of an auction, where a buyer holds in his mind a price limit he will not exceed, for a certain painting he fancies. A consumer surplus occurs if this buyer ultimately purchases the artwork for less than his predetermined limit. In another example, let&#39;s assume the price per barrel of oil drops, causing gas prices to dip below the price a driver is accustomed to shelling out at the pump. In this case, the consumer profits with a surplus.</p><h3>Producer Surplus</h3><p>A producer surplus occurs when goods are sold at a higher price than the lowest price the producer was willing to sell for. In the same auction context, if an auction house sets the opening bid at the lowest price it would comfortably sell a painting, a producer surplus occurs if buyers create a bidding war, thus causing the item to sell for a higher price, far above the opening minimum.</p><h2>Reasons for Surplus</h2><p>A surplus occurs when there is some sort of disconnect between supply and demand for a product, or when some people are willing to pay more for a product than others. Hypothetically speaking, if there were a set price for a certain popular doll, that everyone was unanimously expected and willing to pay, neither a surplus nor a shortage would occur. But this rarely happens in practice, because various people and businesses have different price thresholds&mdash;both when buying and selling.</p><p>Sellers are constantly competing with other vendors to move as much product as possible, at the best value. If demand for the product spikes, the vendor offering the lowest price may run out of supply, which tends to result in general market price increases, causing a producer surplus. The opposite occurs if prices go down, and supply is high, but there is not enough demand, consequently resulting in a consumer surplus.</p><p>Surpluses often occur when the cost of a product is initially set too high, and nobody is willing to pay that price. In such instances, companies often sell the product at a lower cost than initially hoped, in order to move stock.</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><p>2001 was the last year the U.S. federal government had a budget surplus.1</p><h2>Results of Surplus</h2><p>Surplus causes a market&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/disequilibrium.asp">disequilibrium</a>&nbsp;in the supply and demand of a product. This imbalance means that the product cannot efficiently flow through the market. Fortunately, the cycle of surplus and shortage has a way of balancing itself out.</p><p>Sometimes, to remedy this imbalance, the government will step in and implement a&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/floor.asp">price floor</a>&nbsp;or set a minimum price for which a good must be sold. This often results in higher price tags than consumers have been paying, thus benefiting the businesses.</p><p>More often than not, government intervention is not necessary, as this imbalance tends to naturally correct. When producers have a surplus of supply, they must sell the product at lower prices. Consequently, more consumers will purchase the product, now that it&#39;s cheaper. This results in supply shortages if producers cannot meet consumer demand. A shortage in supply causes prices to go back up, consequently causing consumers to turn away from the products because of high prices, and the cycle continues.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Budget surpluses are expected during periods of economic growth. During recessions, when consumer demand declines, budget deficits typically follow.</p><h2>Surplus vs. Deficit</h2><p>A&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deficit.asp">deficit</a>&nbsp;is essentially the opposite of a surplus. A deficit occurs when expenses exceed&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revenue.asp">revenues</a>, imports exceed exports or liabilities exceed assets, resulting in a negative balance. Just as a surplus is not always a positive sign, deficits are not always unintentional or the sign of a government or business that&#39;s in financial trouble. Businesses may deliberately run budget deficits to maximize future earnings opportunities&mdash;such as retaining employees during slow months to ensure themselves of an adequate workforce in busier times.</p><p>On the surface, a surplus is preferable to a deficit.&nbsp;However, this is an overly simplistic assumption.&nbsp;For example, a trade deficit is not inherently bad, as it can be indicative of a strong economy.</p><p>Deficits do carry risks if not handled properly or coupled with a large amount of debt. In the corporate world, running a deficit for too long a period can reduce the company&#39;s share value or even put it out of business.</p><h2>What Is an Example of a Surplus?</h2><p>Take this example of a consumer surplus. Let&#39;s say that you bought an airline ticket for a flight to Miami during school vacation week for $100, but you were expecting and willing to pay $300 for one ticket. The $200 represents your consumer surplus.</p><h2>What Is a Surplus in Economics?</h2><p>Economic surplus consists of consumer surplus and producer surplus. Consumer surplus occurs when the price for a product or service is lower than the highest price a consumer would willingly pay. A producer surplus is when goods are sold at a higher price than the lowest price the producer was willing to sell for.</p><h2>What Is a Surplus Auction?</h2><p>Surplus property is property the government does not need. Personal property includes assets ranging from office equipment and furniture to scientific equipment, heavy machinery, airplanes, vessels, and vehicles. If this property cannot be donated to a state or public agency, or nonprofit organization, the general public can buy it in an auction.</p><h2>How Do You Calculate a Surplus?</h2><p>Surplus is the amount of an asset or resource that exceeds the portion that is utilized. To calculate consumer surplus one merely needs to subtract the actual price the consumer paid by the amount they were willing to pay.</p><h2>The Bottom Line</h2><p>A surplus, generally speaking, occurs when there is more of something than is needed. At first glance, that might sound like a positive for everyone. However, in reality, when there&rsquo;s a disconnect between supply and demand, somebody inevitably suffers and it doesn&#39;t always end well.</p><p>For example, when a business has excess stock and is forced to cut prices to offload what it cannot sell, its profits tighten and its stakeholders suffer while consumers happily capitalize. Conversely, a producer surplus works the other way around, benefiting the business and squeezing the income of consumers. Ideally, a balance is struck to keep all parties happy. Sometimes market dynamics can stray, though, and lead to a nasty recession if&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economic-equilibrium.asp">equilibrium</a>&nbsp;isn&#39;t restored in time.</p>`,

      articleText:
        `<h1>Government Bond</h1><p>A government bond is a debt security a government issues.When a government issues a bond, it is basically accepting a loan. The lender receives interest payments, plus his principal back when the bond matures. If an investor buys a government bond for $1,000 with a 5% interest rate, he will receive $50 every year until it matures, and then his original $1,000 back. The government uses the money it borrows through bonds to fund activities or projects, like repairs on an interstate highway. Examples of government bonds in the United States include savings bonds, Treasury bonds, and Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS). There are many more. Corporations issue bonds to pay for projects, as well, but governments are the largest issuers of debt securities, and deemed the safest. Since government bonds in the U.S. are backed by the full faith of the federal government, the chances that they will default are tiny. But it&rsquo;s important to remember that low risk means lower returns, and borrowers of a government bond will typically receive smaller interest rates than what they would receive for a corporate bond, which has a higher risk of default. Investors should assess the risk of a government bond as it applies to the specific country issuing the debt. There is country risk, or the combination of risk stemming from political, exchange rate, economic, sovereign and transfer issues. These may be minimal in the U.S., but considerable elsewhere.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Corporate Bond: Definition and How They&#39;re Bought and Sold</h1><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>What Is a Corporate Bond?</h2><p>A corporate bond is a type of debt security that is issued by a firm and sold to investors. The company gets the capital it needs and in return the investor is paid a pre-established number of interest payments at either a fixed or variable interest rate. When the bond expires, or &quot;reaches maturity,&quot; the payments cease and the original investment is returned.</p><p>The backing for the bond is generally the ability of the company to repay, which depends on its prospects for future revenues and profitability. In some cases, the company&#39;s physical assets may be used as&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/collateral.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">collateral</a>.</p><h3>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h3><ul>	<li>A corporate bond is debt issued by a company in order for it to raise capital.</li>	<li>An investor who buys a corporate bond is effectively lending money to the company in return for a series of interest payments, but these bonds may also actively trade on the secondary market.</li>	<li>Corporate bonds are typically seen as somewhat riskier than U.S. government bonds, so they usually have higher interest rates to compensate for this additional risk.</li>	<li>The highest quality (and safest, lower yielding) bonds are commonly referred to as &quot;Triple-A&quot; bonds, while the least creditworthy are termed &quot;junk&quot;.</li></ul><h2>Understanding Corporate Bonds</h2><p>In the investment hierarchy, high-quality corporate bonds are considered a relatively safe and conservative investment. Investors building balanced portfolios often add bonds in order to offset riskier investments such as growth stocks. Over a lifetime, these investors tend to add more bonds and fewer risky investments in order to safeguard their accumulated capital. Retirees often invest a larger portion of their assets in bonds in order to establish a reliable income supplement.</p><p>In general, corporate bonds are considered to have a higher risk than U.S.&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/government-bond.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">government bonds</a>. As a result, interest rates are almost always higher on corporate bonds, even for companies with top-flight&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditquality.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">credit quality</a>. The difference between the yields on highly-rated corporate bonds and U.S. Treasuries is called the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditspread.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">credit spread</a>.</p><h2>Corporate Bond Ratings</h2><p>Before being issued to investors, bonds are reviewed for the creditworthiness of the issuer by one or more of&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond-rating-agencies.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">three U.S. rating agencies</a>: Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s Global Ratings, Moody&#39;s Investor Services, and Fitch Ratings.1﻿&nbsp;2﻿&nbsp;3﻿ Each has its own ranking system, but the highest-rated bonds are commonly referred to as &quot;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aaa.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Triple-A</a>&quot; rated bonds. The lowest rated corporate bonds are called high-yield bonds due to their greater interest rate applied to compensate for their higher risk. These are also known as&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/junkbond.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">&quot;junk&quot; bonds</a>.</p><p>Bond ratings are vital to alerting investors to the quality and stability of the bond in question. These ratings consequently greatly influence interest rates, investment appetite, and bond pricing.</p><h2>How Corporate Bonds Are Sold</h2><p>Corporate bonds are issued in blocks of $1,000 in face or par value. Almost all have a standard coupon payment structure. Typically a corporate issuer will enlist the help of an investment bank to underwrite and market the bond offering to investors.</p><p>The investor receives regular interest payments from the issuer until the bond matures. At that point, the investor reclaims the face value of the bond. The bonds may have a fixed interest rate or a rate that floats according to the movements of a particular economic indicator.</p><p>Corporate bonds sometimes have&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/callprovision.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">call provisions</a>&nbsp;to allow for early prepayment if prevailing interest rates change so dramatically that the company deems it can do better by issuing a new bond.</p><p>Investors may also opt to sell bonds before they mature. If a bond is sold, the owner gets less than face value. The amount it is worth is determined primarily by the number of payments that still are due before the bond matures.</p><p>Investors may also gain access to corporate bonds by investing in any number of bond-focused mutual funds or ETFs.</p><h2>Why Corporations Sell Bonds</h2><p>Corporate bonds are a form of&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtfinancing.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">debt financing</a>. They are a major source of capital for many businesses, along with equity, bank loans, and lines of credit. They often are issued to provide the ready cash for a particular project the company wants to undertake. Debt financing is sometimes preferable to issuing stock (equity financing) because it is typically cheaper for the borrowing firm and does not entail giving up any ownership stake or control in the company.</p><p>Generally speaking, a company needs to have consistent earnings potential to be able to offer debt securities to the public at a favorable coupon rate. If a company&#39;s perceived credit quality is higher, it can issue more debt at lower rates.</p><p>When a corporation needs a very short-term capital boost, it may sell commercial paper, which is similar to a bond but typically matures in 270 days or less.</p><h2>The Difference Between Corporate Bonds and Stocks</h2><p>An investor who buys a corporate bond is lending money to the company. An investor who buys stock is buying an ownership share of the company.</p><p>The value of a stock rises and falls, and the investor&#39;s stake rises or falls with it. The investor may make money by selling the stock when it reaches a higher price, or by collecting dividends paid by the company, or both.</p><p>By investing in bonds, an investor is paid in interest rather than profits. The original investment can only be at risk if the company collapses.One important difference is that even a bankrupt company must pay its bondholders and other creditors first. Stock owners may be reimbursed for their losses only after all of those debts are paid in full.</p><p>Companies may also issue&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/convertiblebond.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">convertible bonds</a>, which are able to be turned into shares of the company if certain conditions are met.</p>`,

        `<h1>Game Theory</h1><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>What Is Game Theory?</h2><p>Game theory is a theoretical framework for conceiving social situations&nbsp;among competing players. In some respects, game theory is the science of strategy, or at least the optimal decision-making of independent and competing actors in a strategic setting.</p><h3>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h3><ul>	<li>Game theory is a theoretical framework to conceive social situations among competing players.</li>	<li>The intention of game theory is to produce optimal decision-making of independent and competing actors in a strategic setting.&nbsp;</li>	<li>Using game theory, real-world scenarios for such situations as pricing competition and product releases (and many more) can be laid out and their outcomes predicted.&nbsp;</li>	<li>Scenarios include the prisoner&#39;s dilemma and the dictator game among many others.</li>	<li>Different types of game theory include cooperative/non-cooperative, zero-sum/non-zero-sum, and simultaneous/sequential.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>How Game Theory Works</h2><p>The key pioneers of game theory were mathematician John von Neumann and economist Oskar Morgenstern in the 1940s.1&nbsp;Mathematician John Nash is regarded by many as providing the first significant extension of the von Neumann and Morgenstern work.</p><p>The focus of game theory is the game, which serves as a model of an interactive situation among rational players.&nbsp;The key to game theory is that one player&#39;s payoff is contingent on the strategy implemented by the other player.&nbsp;</p><p>The game identifies the players&#39; identities, preferences, and available strategies and how these strategies affect the outcome. Depending on the model, various other requirements or assumptions may be necessary.</p><p>Game theory has a wide range of applications, including psychology, evolutionary biology, war, politics, economics, and business. Despite its many advances, game theory is still a young and developing science.</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><p>According to game theory, the actions and choices of all the participants affect the outcome of each. It&#39;s assumed players within the game are rational and will strive to maximize their payoffs in the game.2</p><h2>Useful Terms in Game Theory</h2><p>Any time we have a situation with two or more players that involve known payouts or quantifiable consequences, we can use game theory to help determine the most likely outcomes. Let&#39;s start by defining a few terms commonly used in the study of game theory:</p><ul>	<li><strong>Game</strong>:&nbsp;Any set of circumstances that has a result dependent on the actions of two or more decision-makers (players)</li>	<li><strong>Players</strong>:&nbsp;A strategic decision-maker within the context of the game</li>	<li><strong>Strategy</strong>:&nbsp;A complete plan of action a player will take given the set of circumstances that might arise within the game</li>	<li><strong>Payoff</strong>:<em>&nbsp;</em>The payout a player receives from arriving at a particular outcome (The payout can be in any quantifiable form, from dollars to&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/utility.asp">utility</a>.)</li>	<li><strong>Information set</strong>:&nbsp;The information available at a given point in the game (The term information set is most usually applied when the game has a sequential component.)</li>	<li><strong>Equilibrium</strong>:&nbsp;The point in a game where both players have made their decisions and an outcome is reached</li></ul><h2>The Nash Equilibrium</h2><p><aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nash-equilibrium.asp">Nash equilibrium</a>&nbsp;is an outcome reached that, once achieved, means no player can increase payoff by changing decisions unilaterally. It can also be thought of as &quot;no regrets,&quot; in the sense that once a decision is made, the player will have no regrets concerning decisions considering the consequences.</p><p>The Nash equilibrium is reached over time, in most cases. However, once the Nash equilibrium is reached, it will not be deviated from. After we learn how to find the Nash equilibrium, take a look at how a unilateral move would affect the situation. Does it make any sense? It shouldn&#39;t, and that&#39;s why the Nash equilibrium is described as &quot;no regrets.&quot; Generally, there can be more than one equilibrium in a game.</p><p>However, this usually occurs in games with more complex elements than two choices by two players. In simultaneous games that are repeated over time, one of these multiple equilibria is reached after some trial and error. This scenario of different choices overtime before reaching equilibrium is the most often played out in the business world when two firms are determining prices for highly interchangeable products, such as airfare or soft drinks.</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><p>Ever seen an opposing coach call a timeout right before the other team&#39;s kicker is to attempt a game-winning field goal? Th</p><h2>Impact of Game Theory</h2><p>Game theory is present in almost every industry or field of research. Its expansive theory can pertain to many situations, making it a versatile and important theory to comprehend. Here are several fields of study directly impacted by game theory.</p><h3>Economics</h3><p>Game theory brought about a revolution in economics by addressing crucial problems in prior mathematical economic models. For instance, neoclassical economics struggled to understand&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/entrepreneur.asp">entrepreneurial</a>&nbsp;anticipation and could not handle the imperfect competition. Game theory turned attention away from steady-state equilibrium toward the market process.</p><p>Economists often use game theory to understand&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/oligopoly.asp">oligopoly</a>&nbsp;firm behavior.&nbsp;It helps to predict likely outcomes when firms engage in certain behaviors, such as price-fixing and&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/collusion.asp">collusion</a>.</p><h3>Business</h3><p>In business, game theory is beneficial for modeling competing behaviors between economic agents.&nbsp;Businesses often have several strategic choices that affect their ability to realize economic gain.&nbsp;For example, businesses may face dilemmas such as whether to retire existing products or develop new ones or employ new marketing strategies.&nbsp;</p><p>Businesses can often choose their opponent as well. Some focus on external forces and compete against other market participants. Others set internal goals and strive to be better than previous versions of itself. Whether external or internal, companies are always competing for resources, attempting to hire the best candidates away from their&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rival_good.asp">rivals</a>, and gather the attention of customers away from competing goods.</p><p>Game theory in business may most resemble a game tree as shown below. A company may start in position one and must decide upon two outcomes. However, there are continually other decisions to be made; the final payoff amount is not known until the final decision has been processed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Example of Game Tree.</p><p>Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy</p><h3>Project Management</h3><p><aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/project-management.asp">Project management</a>&nbsp;involves social aspects of game theory as different participants may have different influences. For example, a project manager may be incentivized to successfully complete a building development project. Meanwhile, the construction worker may be incentivized to work slower for safety or delay the project to incur more billable hours.</p><p>When dealing with an internal team, game theory may be less prevalent as all participants working for the same employer often have a greater shared interest for success. However, third-party consultants or external parties assisting with a project may be incentivized by other means separate from the project&#39;s success.</p><h3>Consumer Product Pricing</h3><p>The strategy of&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blackfriday.asp">Black Friday</a>&nbsp;shopping is at the heart of game theory. The concept holds that should companies reduce prices, more consumers will buy more goods. The relationship between a consumer, a good, and the financial exchange to transfer ownership plays a major part in game theory as each consumer has a different set of expectations.</p><p>Outside from sweeping sales in advance of the holiday season, companies must utilize game theory when pricing products for launch or in anticipation of competition from rival goods. The company must balance pricing a good too low and not reaping profit, yet pricing a good too high may scare customers away towards a substitute good.</p><h2>Types of Game Theories</h2><h3>Cooperative vs. Non-Cooperative Games</h3><p>Although there are many types (e.g., symmetric/asymmetric, simultaneous/sequential, etc.) of game theories, cooperative and non-cooperative game theories are the most common.&nbsp;Cooperative game theory deals with how coalitions, or cooperative groups, interact when only the payoffs are known.&nbsp;It is a game between coalitions of players rather than between individuals, and it questions how groups form and how they allocate the payoff among players.</p><p>Non-cooperative game theory deals with how rational economic agents deal with each other to achieve their own goals.&nbsp;The most common non-cooperative game is the strategic game, in which only the available strategies and the outcomes that result from a combination of choices are listed.&nbsp;A simplistic example of a real-world non-cooperative game is rock-paper-scissors.&nbsp;</p><h3>Zero-Sum vs. Non-Zero Sum Games</h3><p>When there is a direct conflict between multiple parties striving for the same outcome, this type of game is often a&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/z/zero-sumgame.asp">zero-sum game</a>. This means that for every winner, there is a loser. Alternatively, it means that the collective net benefit received is equal to the collective net benefit lost. Almost every sporting event is a zero-sum game in which one team wins and one team loses.</p><p>A non-zero-sum game is one in which all participants can win or lose at the same time. Consider business partnerships that are mutually beneficial and foster value for both entities. Instead of competing and attempting to &quot;win&quot;, both parties benefit.</p><p>Investing and trading stocks is sometimes considered a zero-sum game. After all, one market participant will buy a stock and another participant sell that same stock for the same price. However, because different investors have different risk appetites and investing goals, it may be mutually beneficial for both parties to transact.</p><h3>Simultaneous Move vs. Sequential Move Games</h3><p>Many times in life, game theory presents itself in simultaneous move situations. This means each participant must continually make decisions at the same time their opponent is making decisions. As companies devise their marketing, product development, and operational plans, competing companies are also doing the same thing at the same time.</p><p>In some cases, there is intentional staggering of decision-making steps in which one party is able to see the other party&#39;s moves before making their own. This is usually always present in&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/negotiation.asp">negotiations</a>; one party lists their demands, then the other party has a designated amount of time to respond and list their own.</p><h3>One Shot vs. Repeated Games</h3><p>Last, game theory can begin and end in a single instance. Like much of life, the underlying competition starts, progresses, ends, and cannot be redone. This is often the case with equity traders that must wisely choose their entry point and exit point as their decision may not easily be undone or retried.</p><p>On the other hand, some repeated games continue on and seamlessly never end. These types of games often contain the same participants each time, and each party has the knowledge of what occurred last time. For example, consider rival companies trying to price their goods. Whenever one makes a price adjustment, so may the other. This circular competition repeats itself across product cycles or sale seasonality.</p><p>In the example below, a depiction of the Prisoner&#39;s Dilemma (discussed in the next section) is shown. In this depiction, after the first iteration occurs, there is no payoff. Instead, a second iteration of the game occurs, bringing with it a new set of outcomes not possible under one shot games.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Example of Repeated Game.</p><p>Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy</p><h2>Examples of Game Theory</h2><p>There are several &quot;games&quot; that game theory analyzes. Below, we will just briefly describe a few of these.</p><h3>The Prisoner&#39;s Dilemma</h3><p>The&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/prisoners-dilemma.asp">Prisoner&#39;s Dilemma</a>&nbsp;is the most well-known example of game theory.&nbsp;Consider the example of two criminals arrested for a crime. Prosecutors have no hard evidence to convict them. However, to gain a confession, officials remove the prisoners from their solitary cells and question each one in separate chambers.&nbsp;Neither prisoner has the means to communicate with each other.&nbsp;Officials present four deals, often displayed as a 2 x 2 box.</p><ol>	<li>If both confess, they will each receive a five-year prison sentence.&nbsp;</li>	<li>If Prisoner 1 confesses, but Prisoner 2 does not, Prisoner 1 will get three years and Prisoner 2 will get nine years.&nbsp;</li>	<li>If Prisoner 2 confesses, but Prisoner 1 does not, Prisoner 1 will get 10 years, and Prisoner 2 will get two years.&nbsp;</li>	<li>If neither confesses, each will serve two years in prison.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>The most favorable strategy is to not confess.&nbsp;However, neither is aware of the other&#39;s strategy and without certainty that one will not confess, both will likely confess and receive a five-year prison sentence.&nbsp;The Nash equilibrium suggests that in a prisoner&#39;s dilemma, both players will make the move that is best for them individually but worse for them collectively.</p><p>The expression &quot;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tit-for-tat.asp">tit for tat</a>&quot; has been determined to be the optimal strategy for optimizing a prisoner&#39;s dilemma. Tit for tat was introduced by Anatol Rapoport, who developed a strategy in which each participant in an iterated prisoner&#39;s dilemma follows a course of action consistent with their opponent&#39;s previous turn. For example, if provoked, a player subsequently responds with retaliation; if unprovoked, the player cooperates.</p><p>The image below depicts the dilemma where the choice of the participant on the column and the choice of the participant in the row may clash. For example, both parties may receive the most favorable outcome if both choose row/column 1. However, each faces the risk of strong adverse outcomes should the other party not choose the same outcome.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Example of Static Two-Person Game.</p><p>Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy</p><h3>Dictator Game&nbsp;</h3><p>This is a simple game in which Player A must decide how to split a cash prize with Player B, who has no input into Player A&rsquo;s decision. While this is not a game theory strategy&nbsp;<em>per se</em>, it does provide some interesting insights into people&rsquo;s behavior. Experiments reveal about 50% keep all the money to themselves,&nbsp;5% split it equally,&nbsp;and the other 45% give the other participant a smaller share.</p><p>The dictator game is closely related to the ultimatum game, in which Player A is given a set amount of money, part of which has to be given to Player B, who can accept or reject the amount given. The catch is&nbsp;if the second player rejects the amount offered, both A and B get nothing. The dictator and ultimatum games hold important lessons for issues such as charitable giving and&nbsp;philanthropy.</p><h3>Volunteer&rsquo;s Dilemma</h3><p>In a volunteer&rsquo;s dilemma, someone has to undertake a chore or job for the common good. The worst possible outcome is realized if nobody volunteers. For example, consider a company in which&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-theory/11/detecting-financial-fraud.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">accounting fraud is rampant</a>, though top management is unaware of it. Some junior employees in the accounting department are aware of the fraud but hesitate to tell top management&nbsp;because it would result in the employees involved in the fraud being fired and most likely prosecuted.</p><p>Being labeled as a&nbsp;whistleblower&nbsp;may also have some repercussions down the line. But if nobody volunteers, the large-scale fraud may result in the company&rsquo;s eventual&nbsp;bankruptcy&nbsp;and the loss of everyone&rsquo;s jobs.</p><h3>The Centipede Game</h3><p>The&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/centipede-game.asp">centipede game</a>&nbsp;is an extensive-form game in&nbsp;game theory&nbsp;in which two players alternately get a chance to take the larger share of a slowly increasing money stash. It is arranged so that if a player passes the stash to their opponent who then takes the stash, the player receives a smaller amount than if they had taken the pot.</p><p>The centipede game concludes as soon as a player takes the stash, with that player getting the larger portion and the other player getting the smaller portion. The game has a pre-defined total number of rounds, which are known to each player in advance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Game theory exists in almost every facet of life. Because the decisions of other people around you impact your day, game theory pertains to personal relationships, shopping habits, media intake, and hobbies.</p><h2>Types of Game Theory Strategies</h2><p>Game theory participants can decide between a few primary ways to play their game. In general, each participant must decide what level of risk they are wiling to take and how far they are wiling to go to pursue the best possible outcome.</p><h3>Maximax Strategy</h3><p>A maximax strategy involves no hedging. The participant is either all in or all out; they&#39;ll either win big or face the worst consequence. Consider new&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/startup.asp">start-up</a>&nbsp;companies introducing new products to the market. Their new product may result in the company&#39;s market cap increasing fifty-fold. On the other hand, a failed product launch will leave the company bankrupt. In either situation, the participant is willing to take a chance on achieving the best outcome even if the worst outcome is possible.</p><h3>Maximin Strategy</h3><p>A maximin strategy in game theory results in the participant choosing the best of the worst payoff. The participant has decided to&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedge.asp#:~:text=What%20Is%20Hedging%20Against%20Risk,making%20a%20trade%20in%20another.">hedge</a>&nbsp;risk and sacrifice full benefit in exchange for avoiding the worst outcome. Often, companies face and accept this strategy when considering lawsuits. By settling out of court and avoid a public trial, companies agree to an adverse outcome. However, that outcome could have been worse due to the exploits of the trial or even worse judicial finding.</p><h3>Dominant Strategy</h3><p>In a dominant strategy, a participant performs actions that are the best outcome for the play irrespective of what other participants decide to do. In business, this may a situation where a company decides to&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/scalability.asp">scale</a>&nbsp;and expand to a new market whether or not a competing company has decided to move into the market as well. In Prisoner&#39;s Dilemma, the dominant strategy would be to confess.</p><h3>Pure Strategy</h3><p>Pure strategy entails the least amount of strategic decision-making, as pure strategy is simply a defined choice that is made regardless of external forces or actions of others. Consider a game of rock-paper-scissors in which one participant decides to throw the same shape each trial. As the outcome for this participant is well-defined in advance (outcomes are either a specific shape or not that specific shape), the strategy is defined as pure.</p><h3>Mixed Strategy</h3><p>A mixed strategy may seem like random chance, but there is much thought that must go into devising a plan of mixing elements or actions. Consider the relationship between a baseball pitcher and batter. The pitcher cannot throw the same pitch each time; otherwise, the batter could predict what would come next. Instead, the pitcher must mix its strategy from pitch to pitch to create a sense of unpredictability in which it hopes to benefit from.</p><h2>Limitations of Game Theory</h2><p>The biggest issue with game theory is that, like most other economic models, it relies on the assumption that people are rational actors that are self-interested and utility-maximizing. Of course, we are social beings who do cooperate often at our own expense. Game theory cannot account for the fact that in some situations we may fall into a Nash equilibrium, and other times not, depending on the social context and who the players are.</p><p>In addition, game theory often struggles to factor in human elements such as loyalty, honesty, or empathy. Though statistical and mathematical computations can dictate what a best course of action should be, humans may not take this course due to incalculable and complex scenarios of self-sacrifice or manipulation. Game theory may analyze a set of behaviors but it can not truly forecast the human element.</p><h2>What Are the Games Being Played in Game Theory?</h2><p>It is called game theory since the theory tries to understand the strategic actions of two or more &quot;players&quot; in a given situation containing set rules and outcomes. While used in several disciplines, game theory is most notably used as a tool within the study of business and economics.</p><p>The &quot;games&quot; may involve how two competitor firms will react to price cuts by the other, whether a firm should acquire another, or how traders in a stock market may react to price changes. In theoretic terms, these&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/111113/advanced-game-theory-strategies-decisionmaking.asp">games may be categorized</a>&nbsp;as prisoner&#39;s dilemmas, the dictator game, the hawk-and-dove, and Bach or Stravinsky.</p><h2>What Are Some of the Assumptions About These Games?</h2><p>Like many economic models, game theory also contains a set of strict assumptions that must hold for the theory to make good predictions in practice. First, all players are utility-maximizing rational actors that have full information about the game, the rules, and the consequences. Players are not allowed to communicate or interact with one another. Possible outcomes are not only known in advance but also cannot be changed. The number of players in a game can theoretically be infinite, but most games will be put into the context of only two players.</p><h2>What Is a Nash Equilibrium?</h2><p>The&nbsp;Nash equilibrium&nbsp;is an important concept referring to a stable state in a game where no player can gain an advantage by unilaterally changing a strategy, assuming the other participants also do not change their strategies. The Nash equilibrium provides the solution concept in a non-cooperative (adversarial) game. It is named after John Nash who received the Nobel Prize in 1994 for his work.3</p><h2>Who Came Up with Game Theory?</h2><p>Game theory is largely attributed to the work of mathematician John von Neumann and economist Oskar Morgenstern in the 1940s and was developed extensively by many other researchers and scholars in the 1950s.1&nbsp;It remains an area of active research and applied science to this day.</p><h2>The Bottom Line</h2><p>Game theory is the study of how competitive strategies and participant actions can influence the outcome of a situation. Relevant to war, biology, and many facets of life, game theory is used in business to represent strategic interactions in which the outcome of one company or product depends on actions taken by other companies or products.</p>`,

The tax collected is used for the betterment of the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economy.asp">economy</a>&nbsp;and all who are living in it.</p><p>In the United States and many other countries in the world, income taxes are applied to some form of money received by a&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxpayer.asp">taxpayer</a>. The money could be income earned from salary,&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalgain.asp">capital gains</a>&nbsp;from investment appreciation,&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp">dividends</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/tax/10/interest-income.asp">interest</a>&nbsp;received as additional income, payments made for goods and services, and so on.</p><p>Tax revenues are used for public services and the operation of the government, as well as for&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/retirement/06/socialsecurity.asp">Social Security</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/070914/medicare-101-do-you-need-all-4-parts.asp">Medicare</a>.1&nbsp;As the large baby boomer generation has aged, Social Security and Medicare have claimed increasingly high proportions of the total federal expenditure of tax revenue.2&nbsp;Throughout U.S. history, tax policy has been a consistent source of political debate.</p><p>A tax requires a percentage of the taxpayer&rsquo;s earnings or money to be taken and remitted to the government. Payment of taxes at rates levied by the government is compulsory, and&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxevasion.asp">tax evasion</a>&mdash;the deliberate failure to pay one&rsquo;s full tax liabilities&mdash;is punishable by law. (On the other hand,&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tax_avoidance.asp">tax avoidance</a>&mdash;actions taken to lessen your tax liability and maximize after-tax income&mdash;is perfectly legal.)3</p><p>Most governments use an agency or department to collect taxes. In the United States, this function is performed federally by the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irs.asp">Internal Revenue Service (IRS)</a>.4</p><h2>Types of Taxes</h2><p>There are several very common types of taxes:</p><ul>	<li><aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incometax.asp">Income tax</a>&mdash;A percentage of generated income that is relinquished to the state or federal government</li>	<li><aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/payrolltax.asp">Payroll tax</a>&mdash;A percentage withheld from an employee&rsquo;s pay by an employer, who pays it to the government on the employee&rsquo;s behalf&nbsp;to fund Medicare and Social Security programs</li>	<li><aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporatetax.asp">Corporate tax</a>&mdash;A percentage of corporate profits taken as tax by the government to fund federal programs</li>	<li><aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/salestax.asp">Sales tax</a>&mdash;Taxes levied on certain goods and services; varies by jurisdiction</li>	<li><aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/propertytax.asp">Property tax</a>&mdash;Based on the value of land and property assets</li>	<li><aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tariff.asp">Tariff</a>&mdash;Taxes on imported goods; imposed with the aim of strengthening domestic businesses</li>	<li><aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/estatetax.asp">Estate tax</a>&mdash;Rate applied to the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fairmarketvalue.asp">fair market value (FMV)</a>&nbsp;of property in a person&rsquo;s estate at the time of death; the total estate must exceed thresholds set by state and federal governments</li></ul><p>Tax systems vary widely among nations, and it is important for individuals and corporations to carefully study a new locale&rsquo;s tax laws before earning income or doing business there.&nbsp;</p><p>Below, we will take a look at various tax situations in the United States. Generally speaking, the federal government levies income, corporate, and payroll taxes; the state levies income and sales taxes; and municipalities or other local governments mainly levy property taxes.5</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Income Tax</h3><p>Like many nations, the United States has a&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/progressivetax.asp">progressive income tax</a>&nbsp;system, through which a higher percentage of tax revenues are collected from high-income individuals or corporations than from low-income individual earners. Taxes are applied through marginal&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxrate.asp">tax rates</a>.6</p><p>A variety of factors affect the marginal tax rate that a taxpayer will pay, including their filing status&mdash;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mfj.asp">married filing jointly</a>,&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mfs.asp">married filing separately</a>,&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/single.asp">single</a>, or&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/head_of_household.asp">head of household</a>. Which status a person files&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/061515/what-difference-between-single-and-married-withholding-tax.asp">can make a significant difference</a>&nbsp;in how much they are taxed. The source of a taxpayer&rsquo;s income also makes a difference in taxation.7&nbsp;It&rsquo;s important to learn the terminology of the different income types that may affect how income is taxed.</p><p><aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital_gains_tax.asp">Capital gains taxes</a>&nbsp;are of particular relevance for investors. Levied and enforced at the federal level, these are taxes on the profit generated when you sell an&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp">asset</a>&nbsp;that&#39;s increased in value.8</p><p>The rate of taxation on the profit depends on the length of time for which the asset was held. Short-term capital gains (on assets sold one year or less after they were acquired) are taxed at the owner&rsquo;s ordinary income tax rate, whereas long-term gains on assets held for more than a year are taxed at a lower capital gains rate&mdash;based on the rationale that lower taxes will encourage high levels of capital investment.8&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/020414/how-long-should-i-keep-my-tax-records.asp">Tax records</a>&nbsp;should be maintained to substantiate the length of ownership when both the assets were sold and the tax return was filed.</p><h3>Payroll Taxes</h3><p>Payroll taxes are withheld from an employee&rsquo;s paycheck by an employer, who remits the amount to the federal government to fund Medicare and Social Security programs. In 2023, employees will pay 1.45% into Medicare on all wages and 6.2% into Social Security on the first $160,200 earned, up from $147,000 in 2022.910</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anyone who earns more than $200,000 as a single filer (or $250,000 for married couples filing jointly) pays an additional 0.9% into Medicare.1112</p><p>Payroll taxes have both an employee portion and an employer portion. The employer remits both the employee portion, described above, and a duplicate amount for the employer portion. The employer rates are the same 6.2% for Social Security up to the wage base limit, and 1.45% for Medicare on all wages. Therefore, the total remitted is 15.3% (6.2% employee Social Security + 6.2% employer Social Security + 1.45% employee Medicare + 1.45% employer Medicare).13</p><p>Payroll taxes and income taxes differ, although both are withheld from an employee&rsquo;s paycheck and remitted to the government. Payroll taxes are specifically to fund Social Security and Medicare programs.14&nbsp;A self-employed individual must pay the equivalent of both the employee and employer portion of payroll taxes through&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/selfemploymenttax.asp">self-employment taxes</a>, which also fund Social Security and Medicare.15</p><h3>Corporate Taxes</h3><p>Corporate taxes are paid on a company&rsquo;s taxable income. The steps to calculate a company&rsquo;s taxable income are:</p><ul>	<li>Sales revenue -&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cogs.asp">cost of goods sold (COGS)</a>=&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grossprofit.asp">gross profit</a></li>	<li>Gross profit -&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operating_expense.asp">operating expenses</a>&nbsp;such as&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/general-and-administrative-expenses.asp">general and administrative expenses (G&amp;A)</a>, selling and marketing,&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/randd.asp">research and development (R&amp;D)</a>,&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depreciation.asp">depreciation</a>, etc. =&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebit.asp">earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)</a></li>	<li>EBIT -&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestexpense.asp">interest expense</a>&nbsp;= taxable income</li></ul><p>The corporate tax rate in the United States is currently a flat rate of 21%. Before the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/taxes/how-gop-tax-bill-affects-you/">Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA)</a>&nbsp;of 2017, the corporate tax rate was 35%.1617</p><p>In August of 2022, the United States Congress passed a new 15% corporate minimum tax into law as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. This new minimum tax only affects U.S. corporations with three-year average book values of $1 billion or more and foreign corporations with three-year average U.S. income over $100 million.18&nbsp;</p><h3>Sales Taxes</h3><p>Sales taxes are charged at the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/point-of-sale.asp">point of sale</a>&nbsp;when a customer executes the payment for a good or service. The business collects the sales tax from the customer and remits the funds to the government.</p><p>Each state can implement its own sales taxes, meaning they vary depending on location. There&#39;s even room for cities and counties to use their own rates, provided that they abide by the taxing rules of their state.19</p><p>In 2022, the highest average state and local sales tax rate was found in Tennessee, at 9.55%. Five states&mdash;Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire, and Oregon&mdash;did not have a state sales tax, although Alaska did allow municipalities to charge local sales tax.19</p><h3>Property Taxes</h3><p>A common property tax in the United States is the real estate&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/advaloremtax.asp">ad valorem</a>&nbsp;tax. A&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/millrate.asp">millage rate</a>&nbsp;is used to calculate real estate taxes; it represents the amount per every $1,000 of a property&rsquo;s assessed value. The property&rsquo;s assessed value is determined by a property&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assessor.asp">assessor</a>&nbsp;appointed by the local government. Reassessments are typically performed every one to five years.20</p><p>Property tax rates vary considerably by jurisdiction and many states also tax&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tangible-personal-property.asp">tangible personal property</a>, such as cars and boats.21</p><p>In FY 2018, the state with the highest property tax collections&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/percapita.asp">per capita</a>&nbsp;was New Jersey at $3,378. (The District of Columbia would rank higher if it was counted with the 50 states, at $3,740 per capita.) The lowest state ranking was $598 per capita in Alabama.22</p><h3>Tariffs</h3><p>A tariff is a&nbsp;tax imposed&nbsp;by one country on the goods and services&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/import.asp">imported</a>&nbsp;from another country. The purpose is to encourage domestic purchases by increasing the price of goods and services imported from other countries.</p><p>There are two main types of tariffs: fixed fee tariffs, which are levied as a fixed cost based on the type of item, and ad valorem tariffs, which are assessed as a percentage of the item&rsquo;s value (like the real estate tax in the previous section).23</p><p>Tariffs are politically divisive, with debate over whether the policies work as intended.23</p><h3>Estate Taxes</h3><p>Estate taxes are levied only on&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/estate.asp">estates</a>&nbsp;that exceed the exclusion limit set by law. In 2023,&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/estate-tax-exemption-2021-definition-5114715">the federal exclusion limit is $12.92 million</a>, up from $12.06 million in 2022. Surviving spouses are exempt from estate taxes.24</p><p>The estate tax due is the taxable estate minus the exclusion limit. For example, a $14.7 million estate would owe estate taxes on $1.78 million.</p><p>The estate tax rate is a progressive marginal rate that increases from 18% to 40%. The maximum estate tax rate of 40% is levied on the portion of an estate that exceeds the exclusion limit by more than $1 million.25</p><p>States may have lower exclusion limits than the federal government, but no state taxes estates worth less than $1 million. Massachusetts and Oregon have the $1 million exemption limits.2627&nbsp;State rates are also different from the federal rate. In 2022, the highest state estate tax rate, implemented in Hawaii and Washington, was 20%.28</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><p>Some states levy their own additional estate or inheritance tax, with exclusion limits that differ from those of the federal government.28</p><p>Estate taxes are different from&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inheritancetax.asp">inheritance taxes</a>&nbsp;in that an estate tax is applied before assets are disbursed to any&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beneficiary.asp">beneficiaries</a>. An inheritance tax is paid by the beneficiary. There is no federal inheritance tax, and, as of 2022, only six states have an inheritance tax: Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Nebraska, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.28</p><h2>Tax Delinquency</h2><p>Every type of tax has a different due date or reporting requirement. Some are collected immediately at the time of a transaction or leading up to a transaction like sales taxes or tariffs. Others are on a fixed recurring schedule with a due date repeating on a specific date or specific day/month combination (i.e. property taxes being due the first day of April). The due dates for similar types of taxes will vary across governing bodies (i.e. different counties will have different property tax due dates).</p><p>Upon failure to remit the appropriate amount of a tax to the taxing authorities, various penalties may be incurred. Regarding the various taxes mentioned above, tax penalties may include:</p><ul>	<li>A penalty assessment resulting in a one-time fee or charge.</li>	<li>An interest assessment resulting in an escalating penalty based on the duration of the delinquency.</li>	<li>A&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lien.asp">lien&nbsp;</a>placed on underlying assets in the event the delinquent party should be unable to satisfy their debts.</li>	<li>A denial of access or service for transaction-related taxes (i.e. tariffs).</li>	<li>A seizure of company property or placement of a lien on the company property for business-related taxes.</li></ul><h2>Why Do We Pay Taxes?</h2><p>Taxes are the primary source of revenue for most governments. Among other things, this money is spent to improve and maintain public infrastructure, including the roads we travel on, and fund public services, such as schools, emergency services, and welfare programs.</p><h2>How Do Income Taxes Work in the U.S.?</h2><p>In the U.S., taxation progressively increases as an individual&rsquo;s income grows. There are currently seven federal tax brackets in the U.S., with rates ranging from 10% to 37%.29</p><h2>Are U.S. Taxes Low?</h2><p>Generally speaking, U.S. taxes are lower than in other developed nations. In 2018, total U.S. tax revenue represented 24% of&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gdp.asp">gross domestic product (GDP)</a>&nbsp;according to the Tax Policy Center, whereas the average among the other 35 member countries of the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/oecd.asp">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)</a>&nbsp;was 34%.30</p><h2>Who Needs to Pay Taxes?</h2><p>The taxpayer will depend on the type of tax and associated regulation for that tax. For example, federal income tax legislation usually only pertains to people who have earned a certain amount of income or adjusted gross income. Corporate taxes may be limited to companies that have performed business in a specific area or are incorporated to do business within a specific country. Each tax is handled differently, and there are often exceptions and qualifications for who the tax pertains to.</p><h2>What Are Different Types of Taxes?</h2><p>Taxes can classified in different ways. Some taxes may be incurred on transactions (i.e. sales taxes or tariffs). Other taxes are incurred on net financial results (i.e. individual income taxes or corporate income taxes). There are also taxes that occur due to one-time or non-recurring events (i.e. estate taxes, capital gains taxes).</p><h2>The Bottom Line</h2><p>There are many types of taxes that are applied in various ways. Understanding what triggers a tax situation can enable taxpayers to manage their finances to minimize the impact of taxes. Techniques that can help include&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-advisors/121914/pros-and-cons-annual-taxloss-harvesting.asp">annual tax-loss harvesting</a>&nbsp;to offset investment gains with investment losses, and&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/estateplanning.asp">estate planning</a>, which works to shelter inherited income for heirs.</p>`,

      articleTopic: "Progressive and Regressive Taxes",
      articleText: `<h1>What Is a Progressive Tax? Advantages and Disadvantages</h1><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>What Is a Progressive Tax?</h2><p>A progressive tax involves a tax rate that increases (or progresses) as taxable income increases. It imposes a lower tax rate on low-income earners and a higher tax rate on those with a higher income. This is usually achieved by creating&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxbracket.asp">tax brackets</a>&nbsp;that group taxpayers by income ranges.</p><p>The income tax system in the U.S. is considered a progressive system, although it has been growing flatter in recent decades. For 2022 and 2023, there are seven tax brackets with rates of 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, and 37%. There were 16 tax brackets in 1985.12</p><h3>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h3><ul>	<li>A progressive tax imposes a higher tax rate on higher taxable incomes than lower ones.</li>	<li>A regressive tax takes a larger percentage of income from low-income individuals than from those with high income.</li>	<li>A sales tax is an example of a regressive tax.</li>	<li>A flat tax is a single income tax rate that applies to all taxable income, no matter how much or how little.</li>	<li>The U.S. Social Security payroll tax is considered a flat tax (with an income cap).3</li></ul><h2>Understanding the Progressive Tax</h2><p>The rationale for a progressive tax is that a flat percentage tax would be a disproportionate burden for people with low incomes. The dollar amount owed may be smaller, but the effect on their real spending power is greater.</p><p>The degree to how progressive a tax structure is depends upon how much of the tax burden is transferred to higher incomes. If one tax code has a low rate of 10%&nbsp;and a high rate of 30%, and another tax code has tax rates ranging from 10% to 80%, the latter is more progressive.</p><h2>Advantages of a Progressive Tax</h2><p>On the pro side, a progressive tax system reduces the tax burden on the people who can least afford to pay. That leaves more money in the pockets of low-wage earners, who are likely to spend more of it on essential goods and stimulate the economy in the process.</p><p>A progressive tax system also tends to collect more taxes than flat taxes&nbsp;or regressive taxes, as the highest percentage of taxes is collected from those with the highest amounts of money.</p><p>A progressive tax also results in those with the greatest amount of resources funding a greater portion of the services that all citizens and businesses rely on, such as road maintenance and public safety.</p><h2>Disadvantages of a Progressive Tax</h2><p>Critics of progressive taxes consider them to be a disincentive to success. They also oppose the system as a means of income redistribution, which they believe punishes the wealthy, upper class, and even the middle class, unfairly.</p><p>Opponents of the progressive tax generally are supporters of low taxes and correspondingly minimal government services.</p><h2>Progressive Tax vs.&nbsp;Regressive Tax</h2><p>The opposite of a progressive tax, a&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/regressivetax.asp">regressive tax</a>&nbsp;takes a larger chunk of disposable income from low-wage earners than from high-wage earners.</p><p>A sales tax is an example of a regressive tax.4&nbsp;If two individuals, one rich and one poor, both buy an identical bag of groceries, both pay the same amount of sales tax. But the poorer person has shelled out a greater percentage of their income in order to purchase those groceries.</p><h2>Progressive Tax vs. Flat Tax</h2><p>A&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/flattax.asp">flat income tax system</a>&nbsp;imposes the same percentage tax rate on everyone, regardless of income. In the U.S., the payroll tax that funds&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/socialsecurity.asp">Social Security</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/medicare.asp">Medicare</a>&nbsp;is often considered a flat tax because all wage earners pay the same percentage. However, for Social Security, this tax has a cap.</p><p>For 2022, the Social Security payroll tax was applied only to earnings up to $147,000. For 2023, that figure is $160,200. That makes it a flat tax on everyone, up to those levels.3</p><p>The Medicare tax applies to all covered wages (there&#39;s no wage cap as there is for the Social Security tax).5</p><h2>Do I Pay the Same Percentage of Tax on All My Income?</h2><p>No. With a progressive tax, you only pay your highest percentage on the portion of income that exceeds the minimum threshold. For example, if a single person makes $100,000 in 2022, they fall into the 24% bracket (as well as lower brackets). However, only the portion of their income that exceeds the bracket&#39;s minimum threshold of over $89,075 is taxed at that rate. Thus, income is taxed at 10% on the first $10,275, then 12% on income up to $41,775, and 22% on income up to $89,075. In this scenario, only $10,925 ($100,000 - $89,075) would be taxed at 24%.</p><h2>How Often Do the Tax Brackets Change?</h2><p>Tax brackets are set by Congress and enforced by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Changes typically come in the form of legislation like the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which kept seven brackets but lowered the rates that applied to almost every one.6</p><h2>What Is the Purpose of a Progressive Tax?</h2><p>Progressive taxes exist so that the burden of paying for government services, oversight, and infrastructure doesn&#39;t fall disproportionately on those earning lower incomes. With a progressive tax system, those who earn less are taxed less. Those who earn more are taxed more. Since the top earners are taxed more and on larger sums of money, a progressive tax also increases the amount of tax revenue coming in.</p><h2>The Bottom Line</h2><p>A progressive tax is a tax that progresses to higher tax rates as taxable income increases. It means that those individuals with low incomes are taxed at lower rates than individuals with higher incomes.</p><p>The U.S. progressive income tax involves tax brackets, each with its own tax rate. For tax years 2022 and 2023, those tax rates are 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, and 37%. While the tax rates didn&#39;t change from 2022 to 2023, the range of income covered by each bracket increased to reflect inflation.</p>`,

The subsidy is typically given to remove some type of burden, and it is often considered to be in the overall interest of the public, given to promote a social good or an economic policy.</p><h3>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h3><ul>	<li>A subsidy is a direct or indirect payment to individuals or firms, usually in the form of a cash payment from the government or a targeted tax cut.</li>	<li>In economic theory, subsidies can be used to offset market failures and externalities to achieve greater economic efficiency.</li>	<li>However, critics of subsidies point to problems with calculating optimal subsidies, overcoming unseen costs, and preventing political incentives from making subsidies more burdensome than they are beneficial.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>How a Subsidy Works</h2><p>A subsidy is generally some form of payment&mdash;provided directly or indirectly&mdash;to the receiving individual or business entity. Subsidies are generally seen as a privileged type of financial aid, as they lessen an associated burden that was previously levied against the receiver or promote a particular action by providing financial support.</p><p>Subsidies have an&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/opportunitycost.asp">opportunity cost</a>. Consider the Great Depression-era agricultural subsidy described later in this story: It had very visible effects, and farmers saw&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profit.asp">profits</a>&nbsp;rise and hired more workers. The invisible costs included what would have happened with all of those dollars without the subsidy. Money from the subsidies had to be taxed from individual income, and consumers were hit again when they faced higher food prices at the grocery store.</p><h2>Types of Subsidies</h2><p>A subsidy typically supports particular sectors of a nation&rsquo;s&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economy.asp">economy</a>. It can assist struggling industries by lowering the burdens placed on them or encourage new developments by providing financial support for the endeavors. Often, these areas are not being effectively supported through the actions of the general economy or may be undercut by activities in rival economies.</p><h3>Direct vs. Indirect Subsidies</h3><p>Direct subsidies are those that involve an actual payment of funds toward a particular individual, group, or industry. Indirect subsidies are those that do not hold a predetermined monetary value or involve actual cash outlays. They can include activities such as price reductions for required goods or services that can be government-supported. This allows the needed items to be purchased below the current&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/open-market-rate.asp">market rate</a>, resulting in savings for those whom the subsidy is designed to help.</p><h3>Government Subsidies</h3><p>There are many forms of subsidies given out by the government. Two of the most common types of individual subsidies are&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/welfare.asp">welfare</a>&nbsp;payments and&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unemployment-income.asp">unemployment benefits</a>.&nbsp;The objective of these types of subsidies is to help people who are temporarily suffering economically.&nbsp;Other subsidies, such as subsidized interest rates on&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/education-loan.asp">student loans</a>, are given to encourage people to further their education.&nbsp;</p><p>With the enactment of the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/affordable-care-act.asp">Affordable Care Act (ACA)</a>, some U.S. families became eligible for subsidies, based on household income and size.1&nbsp;These subsidies are designed to lower the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outofpocket.asp">out-of-pocket costs</a>&nbsp;for insurance premiums. In these instances, the funds associated with the subsidies are sent directly to the insurance company to which premiums are due, lowering the payment amount required from the household.</p><p>Subsidies to businesses are given to support an industry that is struggling against international competition that has lowered prices, such that the domestic business is not profitable without the subsidy.&nbsp;Historically, the vast majority of subsidies in the United States have gone toward four industries: agriculture,&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialinstitution.asp">financial institutions</a>, oil companies, and utility companies.</p><h2>Advantages and Disadvantages of Subsidies</h2><p>Different rationales exist for the provision of public subsidies. Some are economic, some are political, and some come from socioeconomic&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/development-economics.asp">development theory</a>. Development theory suggests that some industries need protection from external competition to maximize domestic benefit.</p><p>Technically speaking, a free market economy is free of subsidies; introducing one transforms it into a&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mixed-economic-system.asp">mixed economy</a>. Economists and policy makers often debate the merits of subsidies and, by extension, the degree to which an economy should be mixed.</p><h3>Advantages</h3><p>Pro-subsidy economists argue that subsidies to particular industries are vital to helping support businesses and the jobs that they create. Economists who promote a mixed economy often argue that subsidies are justifiable to provide the socially optimal level of goods and services, which will lead to&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economic_efficiency.asp">economic efficiency.</a></p><p>In contemporary&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/neoclassical.asp">neoclassical economic</a>&nbsp;models, there are circumstances where the actual supply of a good or service falls below the theoretical&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equilibrium.asp">equilibrium</a>&nbsp;level&mdash;an unwanted shortage, which creates what economists call a market failure.</p><p>One form of correcting this imbalance is to subsidize the good or service being undersupplied. The subsidy lowers the cost for the producers to bring the good or service to market. If the right level of subsidization is provided, all other things being equal, then the market failure should be corrected.</p><p>In other words, according to&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/general-equilibrium-theory.asp">general equilibrium theory</a>, subsidies are necessary when a market failure causes too little production in a specific area. They would theoretically push production back up to optimal levels.</p><p>Some say goods or services provide what economists call positive externalities. A positive&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/externality.asp">externality</a>&nbsp;is achieved whenever an economic activity provides an indirect benefit to a third party.</p><p>However, because the third party does not directly enter into the decision, the activity will only occur to the extent that it directly benefits those directly involved, leaving potential social gains on the table.</p><p>Many subsidies are implemented to encourage activities that produce positive externalities that might not otherwise be provided at the socially optimal threshold. The counterpart of this kind of subsidy is to tax activities that produce negative externalities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some theories of development argue that the governments of&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/ldc.asp">less-developed countries</a>&nbsp;should subsidize domestic industries in their infancy to protect them from international competition. This is a popular technique seen in China and various South American nations at present.</p><h3>Disadvantages</h3><p>Meanwhile, other economists feel&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/freemarket.asp">free market</a>&nbsp;forces should determine if a business survives or fails. If it fails, those resources are allocated to more efficient and profitable use. They argue that subsidies to these businesses simply sustain an inefficient allocation of resources.</p><p>Free market economists are wary of subsidies for a variety of reasons. Some argue that subsidies unnecessarily distort markets, preventing efficient outcomes and diverting resources from more productive uses to less productive ones.</p><p>Similar concerns come from those who suggest that economic calculation is too inexact and that&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/microeconomics.asp">microeconomic models</a>&nbsp;are too unrealistic to ever correctly calculate the impact of market failure. Others suggest that government spending on subsidies is never as effective as government projections claim it will be. The costs and unintended consequences of applying subsidies are rarely worth it, they claim.</p><p>Another problem, antagonists point out, is that the act of subsidizing helps corrupt the political process. According to political theories of&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/regulatory-capture.asp">regulatory capture</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rentseeking.asp">rent seeking</a>, subsidies exist as part of an unholy alliance between big business and the state. Companies often turn to the government to shield themselves from the competition. In turn, businesses donate to politicians or promise them benefits after their political careers.</p><p>Even if a subsidy is created with good intentions, without any conspiracy or self-seeking, it raises the profits of those receiving beneficial treatment, thus creating an incentive to lobby for its continuance, even after the need or its usefulness runs out. This potentially allows political and business interests to create a mutual benefit at the expense of taxpayers and/or competitive firms or industries.</p><h2>The Politics of Subsidies</h2><p>There are a few different ways to evaluate the success of government subsidies. Most economists consider a subsidy a failure if it fails to improve the overall economy. However, policy makers might still consider it a success if it helps achieve a different objective. Most subsidies are long-term failures in the economic sense but still achieve cultural or political goals.</p><p>An example of these competing evaluations could be seen in the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great_depression.asp">Great Depression</a>. Presidents Herbert Hoover and Franklin D. Roosevelt both set price&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/floor.asp">floors</a>&nbsp;on agricultural products and paid farmers to not produce. Their policy goal was to stop food prices from falling and to protect small farmers. To this extent, the subsidy was a success.2</p><p>But the economic effect was quite different. Artificially high food prices lowered the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standard-of-living.asp">standard of living</a>&nbsp;for consumers and forced people to spend more on food than they otherwise would have. Those outside of the farm industry were worse off in absolute economic terms.3</p><p>Sometimes subsidies may appear to have run their course or continue to create an artificial market, but there are other factors that keep them in place. Production subsidies by&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/g-20.asp">G-20</a>&nbsp;countries averaged $290 billion per year from 2017 to 2019, with 95% going toward oil and gas. Meanwhile, 2019 global consumption subsidies were $320 billion, driven largely by oil and gas.&nbsp;</p><p>The combination of production and consumption subsidies in the oil and gas industry creates overconsumption by artificially lowering the price of fossil fuels. However, these subsidies (on both the production and consumption sides) have lots of political and systemic support and pushback from consumer and energy companies that would be impacted if reform did happen.4</p><p>In terms of pragmatic political economy, a subsidy is successful from the point of view of its proponents if it succeeds in transferring wealth to its beneficiaries and contributing to the reelection of its political backers.</p><p>The strongest advocates of subsidies tend to be those who directly or indirectly gain from them, and the political incentive to &ldquo;bring home the bacon&rdquo; to secure support from special interests is a powerful lure for politicians and policy makers.</p><h2>What Is the Difference Between Direct and Indirect Subsidies?</h2><p>Direct subsidies are those that involve an actual payment of funds toward a particular individual, group, or industry. Indirect subsidies are those that do not hold a predetermined monetary value or involve actual cash outlays. These can include activities such as price reductions for required goods or services that can be government-supported.</p><h2>What Is the Position of Subsidy Advocates?</h2><p>Subsidies exist in mixed economies. Proponents argue that subsidies to particular industries are vital to helping support businesses and the jobs that they create. Proponents further contend that subsidies are justifiable to provide the socially optimal level of goods and services, which will lead to economic efficiency.</p><h2>What Is the Position of Subsidy Opponents?</h2><p>Technically speaking, a free market economy is free of subsidies. Subsidy opponents feel free market forces should determine if a business survives or fails. If it fails, those resources will be allocated to more efficient and profitable use. Opponents argue that subsidies unnecessarily distort markets, preventing efficient outcomes as resources are diverted from more productive uses to less productive ones.</p><h2>The Bottom Line</h2><p>A subsidy given to an individual, business or institution&mdash;usually by the government&mdash;can be direct or indirect. They can assist struggling industries, encourage new developments, and promote a social good or policy. Sometimes by helping one sector or group in the economy, they hurt another group, such a subsidy that helps farmers but increases food prices for consumers. Or they can fail economically but achieve cultural or political goals.</p>`,

GST is a digitalized form of VAT where you can also track the goods &amp; services. Both VAT and GST have the same taxation slabs. It is a comprehensive, multistage, destination-based tax: comprehensive because it has subsumed almost all the indirect taxes except a few state taxes. Multi-staged as it is, the GST is imposed at every step in the production process, but is meant to be refunded to all parties in the various stages of production other than the final consumer and as a destination-based tax, it is collected from point of consumption and not point of origin like previous taxes.</p><p>Goods and services are divided into five different tax slabs for collection of tax: 0%, 5%, 12%, 18% and 28%.

Transactions made within a single state are levied with Central GST (CGST) by the Central Government and State GST (SGST) by the State governments. For inter-state transactions and imported goods or services, an Integrated GST (IGST) is levied by the Central Government. GST is a consumption-based tax/destination-based tax, therefore, taxes are paid to the state where the goods or services are consumed not the state in which they were produced. IGST complicates tax collection for State Governments by disabling them from collecting the tax owed to them directly from the Central Government. Under the previous system, a state would only have to deal with a single government in order to collect tax revenue.<sup><aa href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_and_Services_Tax_(India)#cite_note-moneycontrol2-26">[26]</a></sup></p><h3>HSN code</h3><p>India is a member of&nbsp;<aa href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Customs_Organization" title="World Customs Organization">World Customs Organization</a>&nbsp;(WCO) since 1971. It was originally using 6-digit HSN codes to classify commodities for Customs and Central Excise. Later Customs and Central Excise added two more digits to make the codes more precise, resulting in an 8 digit classification. The purpose of HSN codes is to make GST systematic and globally accepted.</p><p>HSN codes will remove the need to upload the detailed description of the goods. This will save time and make filing easier since GST returns are automated.</p><p>If a company has turnover up to&nbsp;₹15 million&nbsp;(US$190,000) in the preceding financial year then they did not mention the HSN code while supplying goods on invoices. If a company has turnover more than&nbsp;₹15 million&nbsp;(US$190,000) but up to&nbsp;₹50 million&nbsp;(US$630,000), then they need to mention the first two digits of HSN code while supplying goods on invoices. If turnover crosses&nbsp;₹50 million&nbsp;(US$630,000) then they shall mention the first 4 digits of HSN code on invoices.</p><h3>Rate</h3><p>The GST is imposed at variable rates on variable items. The rate of GST is 18% for soaps and 28% on washing detergents. GST on movie tickets is based on slabs, with 18% GST for tickets that cost less than ₹100 and 28% GST on tickets costing more than ₹100 and 28% on commercial vehicle and private and 5% on readymade clothes.<sup><aa href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_and_Services_Tax_(India)#cite_note-opinion-27">[27]</a></sup>&nbsp;The rate on under-construction property booking is 12%.<sup><aa href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_and_Services_Tax_(India)#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup>&nbsp;Some industries and products were exempted by the government and remain untaxed under GST, such as dairy products, products of milling industries, fresh vegetables &amp; fruits, meat products, and other groceries and necessities.<sup><aa href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_and_Services_Tax_(India)#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup></p><p>Checkposts across the country were abolished ensuring free and fast movement of goods.<sup><aa href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_and_Services_Tax_(India)#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup>&nbsp;Such efficient transportation of goods was further ensured by subsuming&nbsp;<aa href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octroi" title="Octroi">octroi</a>&nbsp;within the ambit of GST.</p><p>The Central Government had proposed to insulate the revenues of the States from the impact of GST, with the expectation that in due course, GST will be levied on petroleum and petroleum products. The central government had assured states of compensation for any revenue loss incurred by them from the date of GST for a period of five years. However, no concrete laws have yet been made to support such action.<sup><aa href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_and_Services_Tax_(India)#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup>&nbsp;GST council adopted concept paper discouraging tinkering with rates.<sup><aa href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_and_Services_Tax_(India)#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup></p><h3>e-Way Bill</h3><p>An e-Way Bill is an electronic permit for shipping goods similar to a&nbsp;<aa href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waybill" title="Waybill">waybill</a>.

The central bank at that time was primarily responsible for maintaining the convertibility of gold into currency; it issued notes based on a country&#39;s reserves of gold.</p><p>At the outbreak of World War I, the GS was abandoned, and it became apparent that, in times of crisis, governments facing&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/budget-deficit.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">budget deficits</a>&nbsp;(because it costs money to wage war) and needing greater resources would order the printing of more money. As governments did so, they encountered inflation.</p><p>After the war, many governments opted to go back to the GS to try to stabilize their economies. With this rose the awareness of the importance of the central bank&#39;s independence from any political party or administration.</p><p>During the unsettling times of the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great_depression.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Great Depression</a>&nbsp;and the aftermath of World War II, world governments predominantly favored a return to a central bank dependent on the political decision-making process. This view emerged mostly from the need to establish control over war-shattered economies; furthermore, newly independent nations opted to keep control over all aspects of their countries&mdash;a backlash against colonialism.</p><p>The rise of managed economies in the Eastern Bloc was also responsible for increased government interference in the macroeconomy. Eventually,&nbsp;however, the independence of the central bank from the government came back into fashion in Western economies and has prevailed as the optimal way to achieve a liberal and stable economic regime.</p><h2>How the Central Bank Influences an Economy</h2><p>A central bank can be said to have two main kinds of functions: (1)&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/macroeconomics.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">macroeconomic</a>&nbsp;when regulating inflation and price stability and (2)&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/microeconomics.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">microeconomic</a>&nbsp;when functioning as a lender of last resort.</p><h3>Macroeconomic Influences</h3><p>As it is responsible for price stability, the central bank must regulate the level of inflation by controlling money supplies by means of monetary policy. The central bank performs&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/openmarketoperations.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">open market transactions</a>&nbsp;(OMO) that either inject the market with&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">liquidity</a>&nbsp;or absorb extra funds, directly affecting the level of inflation.</p><p>To increase the amount of money in circulation and decrease the interest rate (cost) for borrowing, the central bank can buy&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/government-bond.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">government bonds</a>, bills, or other government-issued notes. This buying can, however, also lead to higher inflation. When it needs to absorb money to reduce inflation, the central bank will sell government bonds on the open market, which increases the interest rate and discourages borrowing.</p><p>Open market operations are the key means by which a central bank controls inflation, money supply, and prices.</p><h3>Microeconomic Influences</h3><p>The establishment of central banks as lenders of last resort has pushed the need for their freedom from commercial banking. A commercial bank offers funds to clients on a first-come, first-serve basis.</p><p>If the commercial bank does not have enough liquidity to meet its clients&#39; demands (commercial banks typically do not hold&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bank-reserve.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">reserves</a>&nbsp;equal to the needs of the entire market), the commercial bank can turn to the central bank to borrow additional funds. This provides the system with stability in an objective way; central banks cannot favor any particular commercial bank. As such, many central banks will hold commercial-bank reserves that are based on a ratio of each commercial bank&#39;s&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deposit.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">deposits</a>.</p><p>Thus, a central bank may require all commercial banks to keep, for example, a 1:10&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reserveratio.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">reserve/deposit ratio</a>. Enforcing a policy of commercial bank reserves functions as another means to control the money supply in the market. Not all central banks, however, require commercial banks to deposit reserves.</p><p>The United Kingdom, for example, does not, while the United States traditionally does. However, the U.S. Central Bank dropped its reserve requirements to zero percent effective March 26, 2020, during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.23</p><p>The rate at which commercial banks and other&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lending-facility.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">lending facilities</a>&nbsp;can borrow short-term funds from the central bank is called the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/discountrate.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">discount rate</a>&nbsp;(which is set by the central bank and provides a base for interest rates).</p><p>It has been argued that, for open market transactions to become more efficient, the discount rate should keep the banks from perpetual borrowing, which would disrupt the market&#39;s money supply and the central bank&#39;s monetary policy. By borrowing too much, the commercial bank will be circulating more money in the system. The use of the discount rate can be restricted by making it unattractive when used repeatedly.</p><h2>Transitional Economies</h2><p>Today developing economies are faced with issues such as the transition from managed to&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/freemarket.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">free market</a>&nbsp;economies. The main concern is often controlling inflation. This can lead to the creation of an independent central bank but can take some time, given that many developing nations want to maintain control over their economies. But government intervention, whether direct or indirect through fiscal policy, can stunt central bank development.</p><p>Unfortunately, many developing nations are faced with civil disorder or war, which can force a government to divert funds away from the development of the economy as a whole. Nonetheless, one factor that seems to be confirmed is that, for a market economy to develop, a stable currency (whether achieved through a fixed or&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/floatingexchangerate.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">floating exchange rate</a>) is needed. However, the central banks in both industrial and&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/emergingmarketeconomy.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">emerging economies</a>&nbsp;are dynamic because there is no guaranteed way to run an economy, regardless of its stage of development.</p><h2>The Bottom Line</h2><p>Central banks are responsible for overseeing the monetary system for a nation (or group of nations), along with a wide range of other responsibilities, from overseeing monetary policy to implementing specific goals such as currency stability, low inflation, and&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fullemployment.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">full employment</a>. The role of the central bank has grown in importance in the last century. To ensure the stability of a country&#39;s currency, the central bank should be the regulator and authority in the banking and monetary systems.</p><p>Contemporary central banks are government-owned, but separate from their country&#39;s ministry or department of finance. Although the central bank is frequently termed the &quot;government&#39;s bank&quot; because it handles the buying and selling of government bonds and other instruments, political decisions should not influence central bank operations.</p><p>Of course, the nature of the relationship between the central bank and the ruling regime varies from country to country and continues to evolve with time.</p>`,

SDRs are an international type of&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monetary-reserve.asp">monetary reserve</a>&nbsp;currency created by the&nbsp;IMF as a supplement to the existing money reserves of member countries.</p><h3>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h3><ul>	<li>The IMF&#39;s mission is to promote global economic growth and financial stability, encourage international trade, and reduce poverty around the world.</li>	<li>The IMF was originally created in 1945 as part of the Bretton Woods agreement, which attempted to encourage international financial cooperation by introducing a system of convertible currencies at fixed exchange rates.1</li>	<li>The IMF collects massive amounts of data on national economies, international trade, and the global economy in aggregate and provides economic forecasts.</li>	<li>One of the IMF&#39;s most important functions is to make loans to countries that are experiencing economic distress to prevent or mitigate financial crises.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Understanding the International Monetary Fund (IMF)</h2><p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is based in Washington, D.C. The organization is currently composed of 190 member countries, each of which has representation on the IMF&#39;s executive board in proportion to its financial importance. Quotas are a key determinant of the voting power in IMF decisions. Votes comprise one vote per SDR100,000&nbsp;of quota plus basic votes (same for all members).23</p><p>The IMF&#39;s website describes its mission as &quot;to foster global monetary cooperation, secure financial stability, facilitate international trade, promote high employment and sustainable economic growth, and reduce poverty around the world.&quot;2</p><h2>History of the IMF</h2><p>The IMF was originally created in 1945 as part of the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brettonwoodsagreement.asp">Bretton Woods Agreement</a>, which attempted to encourage international financial cooperation by introducing a system of convertible currencies at&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedexchangerate.asp">fixed exchange rates</a>. The dollar was redeemable for gold at $35 per ounce at the time.1</p><p>The IMF also acted as a gatekeeper: Countries were not eligible for membership in the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)&mdash;a&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/worldbank.asp">World Bank</a>&nbsp;forerunner that the Bretton Woods agreement created in order to fund the reconstruction of Europe after World War II&mdash;unless they were members of the IMF.45</p><p>Since the Bretton Woods system collapsed in the 1970s, the IMF has promoted the system of&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/floatingexchangerate.asp">floating exchange rates</a>, meaning that market forces determine the value of currencies relative to one another. This system remains in place today.6</p><h2>IMF Activities</h2><p>The IMF&#39;s primary methods for achieving these goals are monitoring capacity building and lending.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The reports the IMF published on its monetary surveillance include the &quot;World Economic Outlook,&quot; the &quot;Global Financial Stability Report,&quot; and the Fiscal Monitor.</p><h3>Surveillance</h3><p>The IMF collects massive amounts of data on national economies,&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/insights/what-is-international-trade/" rel="noopener noreferrer">international trade</a>, and the global economy in aggregate. The organization also provides regularly updated economic forecasts at the national and international levels. These forecasts, published in the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">World Economic Outlook</a>, are accompanied by lengthy discussions on the effect of fiscal, monetary, and trade policies on growth prospects and financial stability.</p><h3>Capacity Building</h3><p>The IMF provides technical assistance, training, and policy advice to member countries through its capacity-building programs. These programs include training in data collection and analysis, which feed into the IMF&#39;s project of monitoring national and global economies.7</p><h3>Lending</h3><p>The IMF makes&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/loan.asp">loans</a>&nbsp;to countries that are experiencing economic distress to prevent or mitigate financial crises. Members contribute the funds for this lending to a pool based on a quota system. In 2019, loan resources in the amount of SDR 11.4 billion (SDR 0.4 billion above target) were secured to support the IMF&rsquo;s concessional lending activities into the next decade.8</p><p>IMF funds are often conditional on recipients making reforms to increase their growth potential and financial stability.&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/structural-adjustment.asp">Structural adjustment</a>&nbsp;programs, as these conditional loans are known, have attracted criticism for exacerbating poverty and reproducing the colonialist structures.9</p><h2>Where Does the IMF Get Its Money?</h2><p>The IMF gets its money through quotas and subscriptions from its member countries. These contributions are based on the size of the country&#39;s economy, making the U.S., with the world&#39;s largest economy, the largest contributor.</p><h2>How Much Are the IMF Grants?</h2><p>IMF grants are given to charities in Washington D.C. and member countries. The grants are meant to foster economic independence through education and economic development.&quot; The average grant size is $15,000.10</p><h2>What Is the Difference Between the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank?</h2><p>The International Monetary Fund is primarily focused on the stability of the global monetary system and monitoring the currencies of the world. The aim of the World Bank is to reduce poverty across the world and strengthen the low- to middle-class populations.</p><h2>The Bottom Line</h2><p>The IMF works to help reduce poverty, encourage trade, and promote financial stability and economic growth around the world. It accomplishes this by monitoring capacity building and providing loans. While the IMF is currently working on these goals with its 190 member nations, the organization has still faced criticism for the possible negative impacts of its structural adjustment programs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>What Is the World Bank, and What Does It Do?</h1><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>What Is the World Bank?</h2><p>The World Bank is an international organization dedicated to providing financing, advice, and research to developing nations to aid their economic advancement. The bank predominantly acts as an organization that attempts to fight poverty by offering developmental assistance to middle- and low-income countries.</p><p>As of 2022, the World Bank identified 17 goals that it aims to achieve by 2030. The top two are stated in their mission statement. The first is to end extreme poverty by decreasing the number of people living on less than $1.90 a day to below 3% of the world population. The second is to increase overall prosperity by increasing income growth in the bottom 40% of every country in the world.12</p><h3>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h3><ul>	<li>The World Bank is an international organization that provides financing, advice, and research to developing nations to help advance their economies.</li>	<li>The World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF)&mdash;founded simultaneously under the Bretton Woods Agreement&mdash;both seek to serve international governments.</li>	<li>The World Bank has expanded to become known as the World Bank Group with five cooperative organizations, sometimes known as the World Banks.</li>	<li>The World Bank Group offers a multitude of proprietary financial assistance, products, and solutions for international governments, as well as a range of research-based thought leadership for the global economy at large.</li>	<li>The World Bank&#39;s Human Capital Project seeks to help nations invest in and develop their human capital to produce a better society and economy.</li></ul><h2>Understanding the World Bank</h2><p>The World Bank is a provider of financial and technical assistance to individual countries around the globe. The bank considers itself a unique financial institution that sets up partnerships to reduce poverty and support economic development.</p><p>The World Bank supplies qualifying governments with low-interest loans, zero-interest credits, and grants, all to support the development of individual economies. Debt borrowings and cash infusions help with global education, healthcare, public administration, infrastructure, and private-sector development. The World Bank also shares information with various entities through policy advice, research and analysis, and technical assistance. It offers advice and training for both the public and private sectors.32</p><h2>Examples of What the World Bank Does</h2><p>The World Bank provides financing, advice, and other resources to developing countries in the areas of education, public safety, health, and other areas of need. Often, nations, organizations, and other institutions partner with the World Bank to sponsor development projects.</p><h3>Human Capital Project</h3><p>In 2017, the World Bank created the Human Capital Project, which seeks to help countries invest in and develop their people to be productive citizens and active contributors to their economy. World leaders are urged to prioritize investments in education, healthcare, and social protections, and, in return, they will realize a stronger economy full of healthy, thriving adults.4</p><p>The Human Capital project outlines how governments should invest in providing quality, affordable childcare to support and improve child development, increase women&#39;s access to better employment opportunities, and increase economic growth, to name a few.5</p><p>To build human capital globally, the World Bank has identified several areas of focus: the Human Capital Index (HCI), measurement and research, and country engagement.4</p><p>Created in October 2018, the Human Capital Index summarizes a nation&#39;s investments in its human capital, specifically concerning health and education. The index is used to identify what is lost from the lack of investments in human capital; it also prompts leaders to think of how to remedy these deficiencies.4</p><p>Beyond analyzing human capital, the World Bank measures the effectiveness of a nation&#39;s educational and healthcare systems. Doing so helps them identify what should be continued and what should be changed. It can also give insight on where to allocate resources.4</p><p>Country engagement requires a country to take a &quot;whole government&quot; approach to addressing factors that compromise human capital. The nation, its leaders, and influencers band together to champion reducing poverty and increasing shared prosperity.4</p><h3>National Immunization Support Project</h3><p>In April 2016, the World Bank approved the National Immunization Support Project for Pakistan. This project, costing an estimated $377.41 million, aims to increase the equitable distribution of vaccines to children ages 0 to 23 months.6</p><p>The project consists of five components that are designed to enhance the country&#39;s vaccine distribution to the most vulnerable. The first component creates a governance structure and addresses logistics, monitoring, and evaluation systems. The second component involves performance planning and the alignment of skilled human resources.6</p><p>The third component increases the awareness of and promotes the program among Pakistan&#39;s citizens, as well as addresses how their schools&#39; curriculum aligns with this initiative. The fourth component makes it possible to obtain the necessary equipment to widely distribute vaccines and increase the supply chain for vaccines. Lastly, the fifth component includes being able to expand the program&#39;s reach and enhance research and development in this field.6</p><h3>Learning for the Future</h3><p>The Learning for the Future project was created to enhance children&#39;s readiness for school and the effectiveness of secondary instruction in specific Kyrgyz Republic communities. The project consists of two components: increasing the equitable access of early childhood education and improving the effectiveness of instruction in secondary education.7</p><p>To meet these objectives, the program establishes 500 community-based kindergarten programs, which will allow for the enrollment of 20,000 children. To increase the effectiveness of instruction, the project finances a training program for 500 new teachers and provides digital resources to complement existing learning resources (e.g., textbooks). The project also assesses how well students learn, cognitively and non-cognitively.7</p><h2>World Bank Financials</h2><p>The World Bank is an organization, rather than a bank. Therefore, its financials are not comparable to traditional financial institutions.</p><p>Within the organization operates different sectors: the International Bank of Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the International Development Association (IDA), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA).8</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><p>As of 2020, the World Bank has loaned the most money, $39.58 billion, to India.9</p><p>The IBRD, the original World Bank, loans money to creditworthy low-income or middle-income countries.10&nbsp;For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, the IBRD recorded net interest revenues of $2,444 million and allocable income of $1,248 million. Its equity-to-loans ratio was 22.6%.11</p><p>The IDA issues credits, or interest-free loans, to the poorest nations.12&nbsp;For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. the World Bank recorded an adjusted net income of $394 million and a deployable strategic capital (DSC) ratio of 30.4%, which is the available capital divided by the capital needed to support the portfolio.13</p><p>IFC provides funds and guidance to the private sector for the purpose of helping developing nations stay on a growth trajectory.14&nbsp;For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, the World Bank recorded net income gain of $4,209 million and a total comprehensive income gain of $5,075 million. Its Capital Utilization Ratio (CUR) ratio was 67%.15</p><p>Lastly, MIGA insures investments to the poorest countries to help reduce poverty and improve the welfare of a nation&#39;s citizens.16&nbsp;For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, MIGA recorded net interest revenues of $81 million.17</p><p>For the fiscal year 2021, the World Bank has distributed $30,522.65 million in IBRD loans, $23,931.96 in interest-free loans or credits, and $12,048.95 million in grants.18</p><h2>History of the World Bank</h2><p>The World Bank was created in 1944 out of the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brettonwoodsagreement.asp">Bretton Woods Agreement</a>, which was secured under the auspices of the United Nations in the latter days of World War II. The Bretton Woods Agreement included several components: a collective international monetary system, the formation of the World Bank, and the creation of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).19</p><p>Since their founding, both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have worked toward many of the same goals. The original goals of both&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/043015/what-difference-between-international-monetary-fund-and-world-bank.asp">the World Bank and IMF</a>&nbsp;were to support European and Asian countries needing financing to fund post-war reconstruction efforts.</p><p>Both the World Bank and IMF outlasted the collective international monetary system which was central to the Bretton Woods Agreement. President Nixon halted the Bretton Woods international monetary system in the 1970s.20&nbsp;However, the World Bank and IMF remained open and continued to thrive on providing worldwide aid.</p><p>The World Bank and IMF are headquartered in Washington, D.C. The World Bank has staff in more than 170 offices worldwide.212</p><p>Though titled as a bank, the World Bank, is not necessarily a bank in the traditional, chartered meanings of the word. The World Bank and its subsidiary groups operate within their own provisions and develop their own proprietary financial assistance products, all with the same goal of serving countries&#39; capital needs internationally.2</p><p>The World Bank&rsquo;s counterpart, the IMF, is structured more like a credit fund.22&nbsp;The differing in the structuring of the two entities and their product offerings allows them to provide different types of financial lending and financing support. Each entity also has several of its own distinct responsibilities for serving the global economy.</p><h2>World Banks</h2><p>Through the years, the World Bank has expanded from a single institution to a group of five unique and cooperative institutional organizations, known as the World Banks or collectively as the World Bank Group. The first organization is the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), an institution that provides&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtfinancing.asp">debt financing</a>&nbsp;to governments that are considered middle income.10&nbsp;The second organization within the World Bank Group is the International Development Association (IDA), a group that gives interest-free loans to the governments of poor countries.12</p><p>The&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/international-finance-corporation.asp">International Finance Corporation (IFC),</a>&nbsp;the third organization, focuses on the private sector and provides developing countries with investment financing and financial advisory services.14&nbsp;The fourth part of the World Bank Group is the&nbsp;Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA),&nbsp;an organization that promotes&nbsp;foreign direct investments&nbsp;in developing countries.16&nbsp;The fifth organization is the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), an entity that provides&nbsp;arbitration&nbsp;on international investment disputes.23</p><h2>World Bank FAQs&nbsp;</h2><h3>What Is the Purpose of the World Bank?</h3><p>The World Bank is an organization that provides funds, advice, and research to developing nations to help advance their economy and combat poverty.2</p><h3>Who Owns the World Bank?</h3><p>No person, organization, government, or nation owns the World Bank. It is an organization made up of member countries, represented by a Board of Governors. This Board governs the organization, creates policies, and appoints executive directors. The executive directors govern the Bank&#39;s business and budget, and grant loan approvals. The president and managers manage the day-to-day operations.24</p><h3>Where Does the World Bank Get Its Money?</h3><p>The World Bank receives funding from wealthy nations and from the issuance of debt securities, such as bonds.25</p><h3>Which Country Is the World Bank In?</h3><p>The World Bank is headquartered in Washington D.C.; however, it has locations in more than 170 countries, including Benin, Argentina, and China.26</p><h3>Who Is the CEO of the World Bank?</h3><p>The World Bank is led by President David Malpass.27&nbsp;The organization&#39;s Board of Directors is comprised of four separate Boards, one for each division of the World Bank. Each Board oversees the operations of their respective sector.28&nbsp;For example, the Board for the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) oversees the operations for that segment, and the Board for the International Development Agency (IDA) oversees the operations for that segment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>`,

      articleTopic: "Financial Crisis",
      articleText: `<h1>Financial Crisis: Definition, Causes, and Examples</h1><h2>What Is a Financial Crisis?</h2><p>In a&nbsp;financial crisis,&nbsp;asset prices see a steep decline in value, businesses and consumers are unable to pay their debts, and financial institutions experience liquidity shortages. A financial crisis is often associated with a panic or a&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankrun.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">bank run</a>&nbsp;during which&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0411/5-investors-that-are-both-rich-and-smart.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">investors</a>&nbsp;sell off assets or withdraw money from savings accounts&nbsp;because they fear that the value of those assets will drop if they remain in&nbsp;a financial institution.</p><p>Other situations that may be labeled a financial crisis include the bursting of a speculative financial&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bubble.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">bubble</a>, a&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock-market-crash.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">stock market crash</a>, a&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sovereign-default.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">sovereign default</a>, or a&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/currency-crises.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">currency crisis</a>. A financial crisis may be limited to banks or spread throughout a single economy, the economy of a region, or economies worldwide.</p><h3>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h3><ul>	<li>Banking panics were at the genesis of several financial crises of the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries, many of which led to recessions or depressions.</li>	<li>Stock market crashes, credit crunches, the bursting of financial bubbles, sovereign defaults, and currency crises are all examples of financial crises.</li>	<li>A financial crisis may be limited to a single country or one segment of financial services, but is more likely to spread regionally or globally.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>What Causes a Financial Crisis?</h2><p>A financial crisis may have multiple causes. Generally, a crisis can occur if institutions or assets are&nbsp;overvalued, and can be exacerbated by irrational or herd-like investor behavior. For example, a rapid string of selloffs can result in lower asset prices, prompting individuals to dump assets or make huge savings withdrawals when a bank failure is rumored.</p><p>Contributing factors to a financial crisis include systemic failures, unanticipated or uncontrollable human behavior, incentives to take too much risk, regulatory absence or failures, or contagions that amount to a virus-like spread of problems from one institution or country to the next. If left unchecked, a crisis can cause an&nbsp;economy to go into a recession or depression. Even when measures are taken to avert a financial crisis, they can still happen, accelerate, or deepen.</p><h2>Financial Crisis Examples</h2><p>Financial crises are not uncommon; they have happened for as long as the world has had currency. Some well-known financial crises include:</p><ul>	<li><strong><aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dutch_tulip_bulb_market_bubble.asp">Tulip Mania</a>&nbsp;(1637).</strong>&nbsp;Though some historians argue that this mania did not have so much impact on the Dutch economy, and therefore shouldn&#39;t be considered a financial crisis, it did coincide with an outbreak of bubonic plague which had a significant impact on the country. With this in mind, it is difficult to tell if the crisis was precipitated by over-speculation or by the pandemic.1</li>	<li><strong>Credit Crisis of 1772.</strong>&nbsp;After a period of rapidly expanding credit, this crisis started in March/April in London. Alexander Fordyce, a partner in a large bank, lost a huge sum shorting shares of the East India Company and fled to France to avoid repayment. Panic led to a run on English banks that left more than 20 large banking houses either bankrupt or stopping payments to depositors and creditors. The crisis quickly spread to much of Europe. Historians draw a line from this crisis to the cause of the Boston Tea Party&mdash;unpopular tax legislation in the 13 colonies&mdash;and the resulting unrest that gave birth to the American Revolution.23</li>	<li><strong><aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock-market-crash-1929.asp">Stock Crash of 1929</a>.&nbsp;</strong>This crash, starting on Oct. 24, 1929, saw share prices collapse after a period of wild speculation and borrowing to buy shares. It led to the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great_depression.asp">Great Depression</a>, which was felt worldwide for over a dozen years. Its social impact lasted far longer. One trigger of the crash was a drastic oversupply of commodity crops, which led to a steep decline in prices. A wide range of regulations and market-managing tools were introduced as a result of the crash.45</li>	<li><strong>1973 OPEC Oil Crisis.</strong>&nbsp;OPEC members started an oil embargo in October 1973 targeting countries that backed Israel in the Yom Kippur War. By the end of the embargo, a barrel of oil stood at $12, up from $3. Given that modern economies depend on oil, the higher prices and uncertainty led to the stock market crash of 1973&ndash;74, when a bear market persisted from January 1973 to December 1974 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost about 45% of its value.67</li>	<li><strong>Asian Crisis of 1997&ndash;1998.&nbsp;</strong>This crisis&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asian-financial-crisis.asp">started in July 1997 with the collapse of the Thai baht</a>. Lacking foreign currency, the Thai government was forced to abandon its U.S. dollar peg and let the baht float. The result was a huge devaluation that spread to much of East Asia, also hitting Japan, as well as a huge rise in debt-to-GDP ratios. In its wake, the crisis led to better financial regulation and supervision.8</li>	<li><strong>The 2007-2008 Global Financial Crisis.&nbsp;</strong>This&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-crisis.asp">financial crisis</a>&nbsp;was the worst economic disaster since the Stock Market Crash of 1929. It started with a subprime mortgage lending crisis in 2007 and expanded into a global banking crisis with the failure of investment bank Lehman Brothers in September 2008. Huge bailouts and other measures meant to limit the spread of the damage failed and the global economy fell into recession.9</li>	<li><strong>COVID19 Pandemic</strong>. A global stock market crash began in February 2020. From February 20 until March 23, 2020 the S&amp;P 500 lost over 30% of its value. This was a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused widespread panic and uncertainty about the future of the global economy. Despite being severe and with global reach, markets and national economies rebounded quickly and by early April 2020, the S&amp;P 500 had began a decisive rise, surpassing its pre-pandemic high in August 2020.</li></ul><h2>The 2008 Global Financial Crisis</h2><p>The 2008 Global Financial Crisis remains one of the deepest economic downturns in modern history and deserves special attention, as its causes, effects, response, and lessons are still relevant to the current financial landscape.</p><h3>Loosened Lending Standards</h3><p>The crisis was&nbsp;the result of a sequence of events, each with its own trigger and culminating in the&nbsp;near-collapse of the banking system. It has been argued that the seeds of the crisis were sown as far back as the 1970s with the Community Development Act, which required banks to loosen their credit requirements for lower-income consumers,&nbsp;creating a market for&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/subprime_mortgage.asp">subprime mortgages</a>.10</p><p>The amount of subprime mortgage debt, which was guaranteed by&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/freddiemac.asp">Freddie Mac</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/fannie-mae-loans/">Fannie Mae</a>, continued to expand into the early 2000s when&nbsp;the Federal Reserve Board began to cut interest rates drastically to avoid&nbsp;a recession.1112&nbsp;The combination of loose credit requirements and cheap money spurred a housing boom, which drove speculation,&nbsp;pushing up housing prices and creating a real estate bubble.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A financial crisis can take many forms, including a banking/credit panic or a stock market crash, but differs from a recession, which is often the result of such a crisis.</p><h3>Complex Financial Instruments</h3><p>In the meantime, the investment banks, looking for easy profits in the wake of the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dotcom-bubble.asp">dot-com bust</a>&nbsp;and 2001 recession, created&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cdo.asp">collateralized debt obligations (CDOs)</a>&nbsp;from the mortgages purchased on the secondary market. Because subprime mortgages were bundled with prime mortgages, there was no way for investors to understand the risks associated with the product. When the&nbsp;market for CDOs&nbsp;began to heat&nbsp;up, the housing bubble that had been building for several years had finally burst. As housing prices fell, subprime borrowers began to default on loans that were worth more than their homes, accelerating the decline in prices.13</p><h3>Failures Begin, Contagion Spreads</h3><p>When investors realized the CDOs were&nbsp;worthless due to the toxic debt they represented, they attempted&nbsp;to unload the obligations. However, there was no market for the CDOs. The subsequent cascade of subprime lender failures&nbsp;created liquidity&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contagion.asp">contagion</a>&nbsp;that reached the upper tiers of the banking system. Two major investment banks, Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns, collapsed under the weight of their exposure to subprime debt, and more than 450 banks failed over the next five years. Several of the major banks were on the brink of failure and were rescued by a taxpayer-funded bailout.1415</p><h3>Response</h3><p>The U.S. Government responded to the Financial Crisis by lowering interest rates to nearly zero, buying back mortgage and government debt, and bailing out some struggling financial institutions.16&nbsp;With rates so low, bond yields became far less attractive to investors when compared to stocks. The government response ignited the stock market. By March 2013, the S&amp;P bounced back from the crisis and continued on its 10-year bull run from 2009 to 2019 to climb to about 250%.17&nbsp;The U.S. housing market recovered in most major cities, and the unemployment rate fell as businesses began to hire and make more investments.</p><h3>New Regulations</h3><p>One big upshot of the crisis was the adoption of the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dodd-frank-financial-regulatory-reform-bill.asp">Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act</a>, a massive piece of financial reform legislation passed by the Obama administration in 2010. Dodd-Frank brought wholesale changes to every aspect of the U.S. financial regulatory environment, which touched every regulatory body and every financial services business. Notably, Dodd-Frank had the following effects:</p><ul>	<li>More comprehensive regulation of financial markets, including more oversight of derivatives, which were brought into exchanges.</li>	<li>Regulatory agencies, which had been numerous and sometimes redundant, were consolidated.</li>	<li>A new body, the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-stability-oversight-council.asp">Financial Stability Oversight Council</a>, was devised to monitor systemic risk.</li>	<li>Greater investor protections were introduced, including a new consumer protection agency (the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-cfpb.asp">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a>) and standards for &quot;plain-vanilla&quot; products.</li>	<li>The introduction of processes and tools (such as cash infusions) is meant to help with the winding down of failed financial institutions.</li>	<li>Measures meant to improve standards, accounting, and regulation of credit rating agencies.18</li></ul><h2>The 2020 Financial Crisis</h2><p>In February of 2020, the COVID19 virus was discovered in China. The disease soon made its way around the world, killing millions and stoking fear. This, in turn, caused markets to fall and credit to the financial system to grind to a halt.</p><p>The pandemic resulted in strict lockdowns and travel restrictions, which had a significant impact on global supply chains, consumer demand, and financial markets. Investors became increasingly concerned about the economic consequences of the pandemic, leading to a rapid sell-off in stock markets around the world. The crash was particularly severe in March 2020, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) experienced its worst day since 1987, falling over 2,000 points in a single day. Other major stock indexes, such as the S&amp;P 500 and the FTSE 100, also experienced significant losses. From February 12 through March 23, 2020, the DJIA lost 37% of its value.19</p><p>Central banks and governments around the world responded with various measures to stabilize the financial system and support the economy, including monetary stimulus and fiscal policies such as government spending and tax breaks.</p><p>Despite the severity of the initial crash, the markets rebounded somewhat in the following months, and many investors saw significant gains toward the end of 2020 and into 2021, where markets hit new all-time highs. However, the long-term economic consequences of the pandemic are still unclear, and many industries and countries are still struggling to recover fully.</p><h2>What Is a Financial Crisis?</h2><p>A financial crisis is when financial instruments and assets decrease significantly in value. As a result, businesses have trouble meeting their financial obligations, and financial institutions lack sufficient cash or convertible assets to fund projects and meet immediate needs. Investors lose confidence in the value of their assets and consumers&#39; incomes and assets are compromised, making it difficult for them to pay their debts.</p><h2>What Causes a Financial Crisis?</h2><p>A financial crisis can be caused by many factors, maybe too many to name. However, often a financial crisis is caused by overvalued assets, systemic and regulatory failures, and resulting consumer panic, such as a large number of customers withdrawing funds from a bank after learning of the institution&#39;s financial troubles. Some believe that financial crises are an inherent feature in how modern capitalist economies function, where the business cycle fuels speculative growth during economic booms, only to be met by contractions and recession. During these contractions, borrowers default on their loans and creditors tighten their lending criteria.</p><h2>What Are the Stages of a Financial Crisis?</h2><p>The financial crisis can be segmented into three stages, beginning with the launch of the crisis. Financial systems fail, generally caused by system and regulatory failures, institutional mismanagement of finances, and more. The next stage involves the breakdown of the financial system, with financial institutions, businesses, and consumers unable to meet obligations. Finally, assets decrease in value, and the overall level of debt increases.</p><h2>What Was the Cause of the 2008 Financial Crisis?</h2><p>Although the crisis was attributed to many breakdowns, it was largely due to the bountiful issuance of sub-prime mortgages, which were frequently sold to investors on the secondary market. Bad debt increased as sub-prime mortgagors defaulted on their loans, leaving secondary market investors scrambling. Investment firms, insurance companies, and financial institutions slaughtered by their involvement with these mortgages required government bailouts as they neared insolvency. The bailouts adversely affected the market, sending stocks plummeting. Other markets responded in tow, creating global panic and an unstable market.</p><h2>What Was the Worst Financial Crisis Ever?</h2><p>Arguably, the worst financial crisis in the last 90 years was the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, which sent stock markets crashing, financial institutions into ruin, and consumers scrambling.</p><h2>The Bottom Line</h2><p>A financial crisis occurs when asset prices drop steeply, businesses and consumers cannot pay their debts, and financial institutions experience liquidity shortages. Various factors contribute to a financial crisis, including systemic failures, unanticipated or uncontrollable human behavior, incentives to take excessive risks, regulatory absence or failures, or natural disasters such as pandemic viruses. Some of the historical examples of financial crises include Tulip Mania, the Credit Crisis of 1772, the Stock Crash of 1929, the 1973 OPEC Oil Crisis, the Asian Crisis of 1997-1998, and the 2008 Global Financial Crisis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>`,

An increase in subprime borrowing began in 1999 as the U.S. government-sponsored mortgage lender&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/fannie-mae-loans/">Federal National Mortgage Association</a>&nbsp;(widely referred to as Fannie Mae) began a concerted effort to make home loans more accessible to those with lower credit and savings than lenders typically required.1</p><p>The idea was to help everyone attain the American dream of homeownership. Since these borrowers were considered high risk, their mortgages had unconventional terms that reflected that risk, such as&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/subprime_mortgage.asp">higher interest rates and variable payments</a>. While many saw great prosperity as the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/subprime_market.asp">subprime market</a>&nbsp;began to explode, others began to see red flags and potential danger for the economy.</p><p>Robert R. Prechter Jr., the founder of Elliott Wave International, consistently argued that the out-of-control mortgage market was a threat to the U.S. economy because the whole industry was dependent on ever-increasing property values.</p><p>As of 2002, Fannie Mae and another government-sponsored mortgage lender,&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/freddiemac.asp">Freddie Mac</a>, had extended more than $3 trillion worth of mortgage credit. In his 2002 book,&nbsp;<em>Conquer the Crash</em>, Prechter stated, &quot;confidence is the only thing holding up this giant house of cards.&quot;2</p><p>The role of both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is to repurchase mortgages from the lenders who originated them and make money when mortgage notes are paid. Thus, ever-increasing mortgage&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/defaultrate.asp">default rates</a>&nbsp;led to a crippling decrease in revenue for these two companies.</p><h3>Adjustable-Rate Mortgages</h3><p>Among the most potentially harmful of the mortgages offered to subprime borrowers were the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestonlyarm.asp">interest-only ARM</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paymentoptionarm.asp">payment option ARM</a>. Both were<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/arm.asp">adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMS)</a>. These mortgage types allow the borrower to make much lower initial payments than would be due under a fixed-rate mortgage. After a period of time, often only two or three years, these ARMs reset, often at higher rates. The payments then fluctuate as frequently as monthly, sometimes resulting in much larger payments than those the borrower paid initially.</p><p>In the up-trending market (and growing housing bubble) that existed from 1999 through 2005, these mortgages were virtually risk-free. Borrowers could end up with positive&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity.asp">equity</a>&nbsp;despite their low mortgage payments because their homes had increased in value since the purchase date. If they could not afford the higher payments after their mortgage rates reset, they could just sell the homes for a profit.</p><p>However, many argued that these creative mortgages were a disaster waiting to happen in the event of a housing market downturn, which would put owners in a&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/negativeequity.asp">negative equity</a>&nbsp;situation and make it impossible to sell.</p><h3>Increased Consumer Debt</h3><p>To compound the potential mortgage risk, total&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumer-debt.asp">consumer debt</a>, in general, continued to grow at an astonishing rate. In 2004, consumer debt hit $2 trillion for the first time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Insatiable investor demand for mortgage-related investments drove the predatory home loan private lending that led up to the 2008 crash.3</p><h2>The Rise of Mortgage-Related Investment Products</h2><p>With the run-up in housing prices, the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mbs.asp">mortgage-backed securities (MBS)</a>&nbsp;market became popular with commercial investors. An MBS is a pool of mortgages grouped into a single security. Investors benefit from the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/premium.asp">premiums</a>&nbsp;and interest payments made toward the individual mortgages that the security contains.</p><p>This market is highly profitable as long as home prices continue to rise and homeowners continue to make their mortgage payments. The risks, however, became all too real as housing prices began to plummet and homeowners in droves began to default on their mortgages. At the time, few people realized how volatile and complicated this&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/07/secondary_mortgage.asp">secondary mortgage market</a>&nbsp;had become.</p><h3>Credit Default Swaps</h3><p>Another popular investment vehicle during this time was the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditderivative.asp">credit derivative</a>, known as a&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditdefaultswap.asp">credit default swap</a>&nbsp;(CDS). CDSs were designed to be a method of hedging against a company&#39;s creditworthiness, similar to insurance. But unlike the insurance market, the CDS market was unregulated. This meant that there was no requirement that the issuers of CDS contracts maintain enough money in their reserves to pay out under a worst-case scenario (such as an economic downturn). In early 2008, this spelled potential disaster for American International Group (AIG), one of the nation&#39;s leading financial companies, when it couldn&#39;t meet claims and announced huge losses in its portfolio of underwritten CDS contracts.</p><h3>$150 billion</h3><p>The amount of&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/american-investment-group-aig-bailout.asp">bailout money AIG received</a>&nbsp;from the U.S. federal government in 2008,4&nbsp;which the company repaid with interest by 2013.</p><h2>The Markets Begin to Decline</h2><p>By March 2007,&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/bear-stearns-collapse.asp">Bear Stearns had failed</a>&nbsp;due to huge losses resulting from underwriting many of the investment vehicles linked to the subprime mortgage market. It became evident that the market was in trouble and the subprime mortgage crisis was looming. Homeowners defaulted at high rates as the creative variations of subprime mortgages reset to higher payments as home prices declined.</p><p>Homeowners were upside down&mdash;they owed more on their mortgages than their homes were worth&mdash;and could no longer just flip their way out of making the new, higher payments. Instead, they lost their homes to foreclosure and often filed for bankruptcy in the process. The&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/subprime-overview.asp">subprime meltdown</a>&nbsp;was taking its toll on homeowners and the real estate market.</p><p>Despite this apparent mess, the financial markets continued higher into Oct. 2007, with the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/djia.asp">Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)</a>&nbsp;reaching a closing high of 14,164 on Oct. 9, 2007.5&nbsp;The turmoil eventually caught up, and by Dec. 2007 the United States had fallen into a&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/recession.asp">recession</a>. By early July 2008, the Dow Jones Industrial Average would trade below 11,000 for the first time in over two years.6&nbsp;That would not be the end of the decline.</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><p>Many borrowers who obtained adjustable-rate subprime mortgages with low initial rates received no information from lenders about the details of such loans and found themselves trapped with unaffordable loan obligations when rates rose.3</p><h2>Lehman Brothers Collapses</h2><p>On Sept. 6, 2008, with the financial markets down nearly 20% from the Oct. 2007 peaks, the government announced its&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/fannie-mae-freddie-mac-credit-crisis.asp">takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac</a>. This was a necessary step due to losses from heavy exposure to the collapsing subprime mortgage market.7</p><p>One week later, on Sept. 14, major investment banking firm&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lehman-brothers.asp">Lehman Brothers</a>&nbsp;succumbed to its own overexposure to the subprime mortgage market. It announced the largest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history at that time.8&nbsp;The next day, markets plummeted and the Dow closed down 499 points at 10,917.9</p><p>The collapse of Lehman led to the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nav.asp">net asset value</a>&nbsp;of the Reserve Primary Fund falling below $1 per share on Sept. 16, 2008. Investors were informed that for every $1 invested, they were entitled to only 97 cents. This drop was due to the holding of commercial paper issued by Lehman and was only the second time in history that a money market fund&#39;s share value had &quot;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/breaking-the-buck.asp">broken the buck</a>.&quot;</p><p>Panic ensued in the&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/moneymarket.asp">money market</a>&nbsp;fund industry, resulting in massive redemption requests. On the same day, Bank of America (BAC) announced&nbsp;<aa href="https://www.investopedia.com/5-companies-owned-by-bac-5093698">it was buying Merrill Lynch</a>, the nation&#39;s largest brokerage company.
